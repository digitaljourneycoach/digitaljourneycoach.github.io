      "letter": "Recommendation to the CEO from the Web Manager \u2013 Usability Expert Perspective\n\nDear CEO,\n\nBased on recent user feedback and analysis of our online services, I would like to highlight areas where we can enhance service efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce administrative costs.\n\nCustomer Persona & Needs:\nOur typical customer, exemplified by David\u2014a 52-year-old council tenant comfortably using smartphones\u2014prefers straightforward, step-by-step online processes without unnecessary complexity. His primary need is to request permission for minor improvements to his flat, such as installing a kitchen or adding a handrail. He also concerns himself with timely updates and clear guidance to avoid misunderstandings or delays.\n\nKey Feedback & Issues:\nThe customer feedback indicates partial clarity in our current information:\n- While the guidance explains when permissions are needed, it lacks explicit instructions on *how* to submit applications online and the associated timelines.\n- Customers like David expressed the need for direct links to relevant forms, simplified step-by-step guides, and clear expectations for processing times.\n- The absence of such details leads to confusion, potential delays, and increased calls or emails to our support teams, raising costs and straining resources.\n\nCurrent Page Content:\nThe existing page includes important information on planning permission and building regulation approval but does not provide:\n- Direct, clickable links to online application forms.\n- Clear, sequential instructions simplified for laypersons.\n- Estimated processing times or instructions on how to receive updates.\n\nRecommendations for Improvements:\n1. Incorporate prominent, clickable links to all relevant online forms directly within the guidance text.\n2. Develop a concise, step-by-step online application guide tailored to typical requests, utilizing visual cues or infographics to enhance comprehension.\n3. Clearly state processing timelines\u2014for example, \"Most applications are decided within X weeks\"\u2014and specify how users will receive updates (e.g., email notifications).\n4. Implement a simple FAQ or troubleshooting section addressing common concerns like delays or submitting additional information.\n5. Optimize the page for mobile use, ensuring all links and instructions are easily navigable on smartphones.\n\nImpact on Customer Experience & Cost Savings:\nEnhancing clarity and streamlining the application process will:\n- Reduce user frustration and reliance on support staff, decreasing operational costs.\n- Increase the likelihood of accurate submissions, reducing administrative back-and-forth.\n- Boost trust and satisfaction among residents, fostering positive engagement with council services.\n- Encourage more residents to use online channels, freeing up resources for complex or high-priority cases.\n\nIn conclusion, targeted improvements focusing on clarity, direct navigability, and transparency will significantly benefit our resident experience and deliver cost efficiencies for the council.\n\nKind regards,\n\n[Name]\nWeb Manager & Usability Specialist"
