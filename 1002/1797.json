      "body": "<h1>Home improvements</h1>\n\n<p>For home improvements, Building Regulations approval will be needed. Ensuring that buildings are constructed to an agreed standard, the regulations are complex, but are essential to promote accessibility, health and safety and energy efficiency in the home.</p>\n\n<p>As a homeowner, you're responsible for your home and any related building work. Works to your home, or the creation of new structures, will most likely need approval.</p>\n\n<p>It is likely that even minor home improvements will require Building Regulations consent. This can be an extremely complex subject, please get in touch with our <a href=\"https://www.coventry.gov.uk/building-control/building-regulations-approval/1\">Building Control team if you want to discuss Building Regulations</a> for your project.</p>\n\n<h2>Building works that require approval</h2>\n\n<p>Most house extensions will require approval. Other popular home improvements that require approval include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>loft conversions</li>\n  <li>dormer window or roof light installation</li>\n  <li>structural alterations such as the removal of a load bearing wall or chimney breast</li>\n  <li>new electrical installations</li>\n  <li>plastering to more than 25% of a wall</li>\n  <li>work on, or new doors or windows in, a load bearing wall</li>\n  <li>new bathrooms</li>\n  <li>staircase repositioning</li>\n  <li>\n    window and door replacement by non&nbsp;\n    <a href=\"https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/product-certification/industry-sector-schemes/construction/windows-and-doors/\">BSI</a>,\n    <a href=\"http://www.certass.co.uk/\">CERTASS</a> or \n    <a href=\"http://www.fensa.org.uk/\">FENSA</a> approved installers\n  </li>\n  <li>new chimney or flue installations and flue works</li>\n  <li>underpinning of foundations</li>\n  <li>re-roofing to more than 25% of the roof</li>\n  <li>septic tank installations</li>\n  <li>cavity wall insulation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is not a complete list however. If you're unsure whether you require Building Regulations approval please contact Building Control.</p>\n\n<h2>Building works that do not need approval</h2>\n\n<p>There are a number of common improvements that do not require approval, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>all work completed by a member of a <a href=\"http://www.competentperson.co.uk/\">Competent Person Scheme</a></li>\n  <li>most conservatories, car ports, detached garages and porches</li>\n  <li>typical garden sheds</li>\n  <li>garden fences and walls</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is again not a complete list and if you\u2019re unsure whether approval is needed, it is always best to contact Building Control.</p>\n\n<h2>Selecting the right builder</h2>\n\n<p>Ensuring your home improvements comply with Building Regulations is your responsibility. Selecting a competent builder helps ensure this. To avoid choosing a poor quality builder you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>get a plan of the work to be done</li>\n  <li>get the right consents and permissions</li>\n  <li>ask friends and family for recommendations</li>\n  <li>ask to see previous and ongoing work</li>\n  <li>get at least 3 quotations</li>\n  <li>obtain a written contract</li>\n  <li>ensure they have the right insurances in place</li>\n  <li>not pay in advance</li>\n  <li>agree to pay final settlement upon receipt of the building control completion certificate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Further advice to help select the best builder for the job is available from the <a href=\"https://www.noroguetradershere.com/\">No Rogue Traders Here</a> scheme, which aims to promote reliable traders. You should also choose a builder that is a member of reputable trade organisation such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.fmb.org.uk/\">The Federation of Master Builders</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.trustmark.org.uk/\">Trustmark</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.builders.org.uk/\">The National Federation of Builders</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.nfrc.co.uk/\">The National Federation of Roofers</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ciob.org/\">The Chartered Institute of Building</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Find a registered electrician</h3>\n<p>View a register of electricians belonging to the various <a href=\"https://www.electricalcompetentperson.co.uk\">competent person schemes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Other permissions needed</h2>\n\n<p>In some cases, other authorisation will be needed before work starts. Advice on what other permission may be needed is available at the <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200128/building_control\">Planning Portal</a>, and for you it may include seeking approval for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200187/your_responsibilities/40/other_permissions_you_may_require/3\">ancient monuments</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200187/your_responsibilities/40/other_permissions_you_may_require/8\">covenants and private rights</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200187/your_responsibilities/37/planning_permission/8\">wildlife and protected species</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200187/your_responsibilities/40/other_permissions_you_may_require/16\">the party wall</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/object-to-a-public-right-of-way-order\">rights of way</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Building works that did not get approval at the time of completing the works</h2>\n\n<p>Especially common when a homeowner is looking to sell their house.</p>\n\n<p>Should you have building works on your property that requires building control approval, you will require a \u2018regularisation\u2019 (or RA) application.</p>\n\n<p>This type of application has its own fee column on our <a href=\"https://www.coventry.gov.uk/building-control/fees\">fee schedule</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(Regularisation applications are VAT exempt.)</p>\n\n<p>After submitting the application and paying the associated fee based on the description of the building works completed, you need to arrange for an inspection to be carried out.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.coventry.gov.uk/building-control/building-regulations-approval/3\">Submit a regularisation application</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  You can then request an inspection via our <a href=\"https://myaccount.coventry.gov.uk/service/Booking_a_building_inspection\">website</a> or by phone on 024 7683 2057.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Submission of plans with your RA application (even if only basic) are recommended, and often will help the registered building inspector (RBI) complete their inspections.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  To complete the inspection phase of this type of application, it is likely that the homeowner or principal contractor of the works will be required to \u2018lay open\u2019 or expose parts of the completed building works.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  This will be at the discretion of the homeowner and not Coventry City Council.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  The recommendation is to speak with an RBI before your first inspection, who typically will be able to direct on where they will need to inspect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Once the inspections are complete and the RBI confirms the building works undertaken complies with building regulations then a completion certificate will be issued (this can take up to 8 weeks).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <strong>Note:</strong><br>\n  Building Works completed before 11 November 1985, do not require regularisation.<br>\n  The completed building works that require regularisation, will need to comply with building regulations at the time of the works being completed.\n</p>\n"
