      "letter": "Dear CEO,\n\nAs the usability lead reviewing recent user feedback and content issues on the Middlesbrough council website, I recommend targeted improvements to enhance service efficiency, reduce unnecessary correspondence, and optimize resource utilization.\n\n**Customer Persona Highlights:**\n- David, a 52-year-old tenant, is comfortable with online services and prefers straightforward, minimal-step digital processes.\n- His key need is to apply for modifications to his council flat via an accessible online form.\n- He currently harbors concerns about delays and missing updates, fearing missteps could impact his tenancy.\n\n**Feedback & Issues Summary:**\n- The recent page content did not provide clear instructions or a direct pathway for David to submit his flat modification request.\n- The feedback indicates that the page content was incomplete and overly technical, causing user confusion and frustration.\n- The technical nature of the instructions, especially the incomplete HTML snippet provided, suggests that the current web content lacks user-focused clarity and straightforward guidance.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvements:**\n1. **Enhance Content Clarity:**\n   - Develop and display a concise, step-by-step guide on how to request flat modifications, including clear eligibility criteria and expected timelines.\n   - Include direct links to an easy-to-fill online form that requires minimal effort and offers file upload options for plans and photos.\n\n2. **Simplify User Journey:**\n   - Ensure the website has a prominent \"Apply for Flat Improvements\" button on the relevant page, leading users directly to the application form.\n   - Incorporate progress indicators and confirmation messages to reassure users about their application's status and update frequency.\n\n3. **Improve Communication and Notifications:**\n   - Implement automated email or SMS updates to keep tenants informed about application progress, addressing David\u2019s concern about delays and missed updates.\n   - Clarify processing times and decision expectations upfront on the application page.\n\n4. **Technical and Content Audit:**\n   - Conduct a comprehensive review of the webpage content to ensure completeness, clarity, and accessibility.\n   - Avoid technical jargon and complex instructions; instead, use plain language tailored to non-specialist users.\n\n**Impact of These Changes:**\nImplementing clearer guidance and streamlined online forms will reduce user uncertainty and reliance on postal communication, significantly decreasing administrative follow-ups, manual inquiries, and processing delays. This will not only improve tenant satisfaction but also save the council money by decreasing staff time spent on clarifying procedures and chasing delayed requests.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on user-friendly content and efficient communication pathways will facilitate a better experience for tenants like David while simultaneously operationalizing resource savings for the council. I am happy to assist further with specific content rewrites or technical implementation strategies.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Name], Web Usability & Service Improvement Lead"
