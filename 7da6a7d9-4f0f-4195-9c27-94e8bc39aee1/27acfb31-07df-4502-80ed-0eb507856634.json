      "letter": "To: CEO\n\nFrom: Web Usability Manager\n\nSubject: Recommendations for Enhancing the Council\u2019s Online Tenant Service Platform\n\nAfter reviewing the recent customer feedback, needs analysis, and the website content related to council tenant improvements, I have identified specific areas where targeted enhancements can significantly improve user experience, streamline processes, and generate cost savings for the council.\n\nPositive Feedback Recognition:\nFirstly, it\u2019s worth noting that the current web pages successfully provide essential contact information and guidance for tenants like David. The clarity of contact channels is good, which helps in maintaining open lines of communication. Congratulations to the web team for establishing a foundation of accessible contact options.\n\nAreas for Improvement & Strategic Recommendations:\n\n1. Clarify Language to Improve Formality and User Understanding\nIssue:\nThe phrase \u201cget our permission in writing\u201d may be perceived as informal or slightly ambiguous.\n\nRecommendation:\nRephrase to \u201cobtain written permission\u201d throughout the page content.\n\nImpact:\nAdopting more formal, clearer language will enhance user trust in the process, reduce misinterpretations, and facilitate compliance, ultimately decreasing the need for follow-up clarifications and saving staff time.\n\n2. Make Step-by-Step Instructions Explicit and User-Friendly\nIssue:\nCurrent guidance states \u201ccomplete the online form below,\u201d but does not specify that users need to upload photos or plans, nor does it walk them through the process.\n\nRecommendation:\nUpdate instructions to explicitly mention:\n- Filling out the online form\n- Uploading relevant photos or plans\n- Confirmation of receipt after submission\n\nImpact:\nProviding clear, step-by-step guidance streamlines the user journey, reduces frustration, and lowers the volume of support queries. This not only enhances user satisfaction but also reduces staff workload and associated costs.\n\n3. Include Estimated Timelines and Clear Contact Guidance\nIssue:\nWhile contact details are provided, there\u2019s no information regarding expected response times, which raises concerns about delays.\n\nRecommendation:\nAdd estimated response times and specify available hours for contact, e.g.:\n- Response expected within 5 working days\n- Contact for urgent inquiries available Monday to Friday, 9am\u20135pm\n\nImpact:\nTransparency around timelines reassures tenants like David, reduces follow-up inquiries, and improves perceived service reliability. This improvement can decrease unnecessary calls and emails, saving administrative resources.\n\nOverall Impact:\nImplementing these improvements will create a more transparent, user-centric online service that better meets tenant needs. Such enhancements can lead to increased efficiency, lower administrative costs, and a stronger perception of responsive municipal services. Over time, this can also promote greater digital engagement, reducing the reliance on paper correspondence and in-person visits.\n\nI recommend prioritizing these updates in the upcoming website review cycle. Doing so will position the council as a forward-thinking authority that values clear communication and accessible services, all while optimizing operational efficiency.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability Manager"
