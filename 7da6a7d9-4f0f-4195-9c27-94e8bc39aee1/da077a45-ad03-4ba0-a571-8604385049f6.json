If this is you, you may find that your boiler is flashing up an error message on its screen, or making strange gurgling noises.</p>\n  <p>With temperatures below freezing it is likely that the condensate pipe from the boiler has frozen, particularly if it is a modern boiler. Follow these instructions on how to unfreeze your condensate boiler pipes.</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Before you start, turn your boiler off at its dedicated switch.</li>\n    <li>If your boiler is on the ground floor, go outside and look for a plastic pipe that comes from the wall that the boiler is mounted on. If you can see the end of it, take a look and see if it's frozen throughout; if you can't see the end it will still be worth trying this method to fix it.</li>\n    <li>If you can't see a pipe coming through the wall, you may have an older type of boiler and will need to call a heating engineer.</li>\n    <li>Now, you need to thaw the pipe, clearing the ice blockage. You can strap a hot water bottle to the pipe, although this takes time. The better option is to use warm water to melt the ice. Don't use boiling water, as this could be dangerous.</li>\n    <li>Now go outside and pour the warm water up and down the length of the condensate pipe. Use at least one large jug load of water to make sure you have got everything out. Now go back in and turn on your boiler, it should start automatically, running through a start-up cycle.</li>\n    <li>If you still get an error message, then you may need to reset the boiler.</li>\n    <li>If this does not work, please call a heating engineer or if you are a council tenant you can arrange one through our repairs service on 0345 600 6400.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h2>Repairs &amp; improvements</h2>\n  <p>The area maintenance managers have a team of directly employed engineers and time-served tradesmen who provide:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>An all year round repair service for our properties.</li>\n    <li>Periodic electrical testing.</li>\n    <li>Regular\u202fgas safety testing, as required by law.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>We aim to provide an excellent repairs and maintenance service to our customers and take pride in keeping your home up to a high standard of repair.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Guidelines for repair priorities</h3>\n  <h4>Priority definitions</h4>\n  <p>To ensure we deal with your repair request efficiently we operate a repair prioritisation scheme.</p>\n  <p>Repair priorities are to be defined as:</p>\n  <h5>Emergency repairs:</h5>\n  <p>Repairs to remedy any unforeseen defect which puts the safety or security of a tenant, or third party, at immediate risk, or which adversely affects the structure of the property.</p>\n  <p>Emergency repairs will be attended within 24 hours. The emergency situation will be made safe. A full repair will be carried out if possible, otherwise further work will be scheduled.</p>\n  <p>Examples of an emergency are:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Complete loss of power to the property.</li>\n    <li>Insecure doors or low-level windows.</li>\n    <li>Leaking pipes where the leak cannot be contained.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>A charge will be applied for all non-emergency callouts, or no access given to repairs operatives.</p>\n  \n  <h5>Routine repairs</h5>\n  <p>Non-emergency repairs where the defect is not causing an immediate risk to person or property and will be attended by appointment.</p>\n  <p>Routine repairs will be attended on appointment at a time agreed with the customer and within 30 working days of the request.</p>\n  <p>Examples of routine repairs are:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Partial loss of power.</li>\n    <li>Insecure windows upper level.</li>\n    <li>Leaking pipes where the leak can be contained and all minor repairs.</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h5>Planned works:</h5>\n  <p>Periodic and planned improvements and repairs to maintain and/or improve the condition of the property. Planned maintenance and improvements will be completed within 90 working days of repair request or need identified.</p>\n  <p>External works will have a completion date range unless access to property is required, in which case an appointment will be made with the customer.</p>\n  <p>Internal works will be attended on appointment. Examples of planned works include external painting programmes, and kitchen replacements.</p>\n  \n  <h5>Exceptions:</h5>\n  <p>Completion of external repairs and planned maintenance are weather dependent, and these appointments may need to be re-scheduled. Customers will be kept informed of any such arrangements.</p>\n  <p>Some repairs may be treated with more urgency if the customer or a member of the household is classed as vulnerable or at risk.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Tenants' Right to Repair</h3>\n  <p>If we do not repair within a set time, you have the right to arrange your own repair. However, not all repairs qualify under the right-to repair scheme.</p>\n  <p>To find out more about how the Right to Repair scheme and what repairs qualify, <a href=\"#\">click\u202fhere</a>.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Empty property standards</h3>\n  <p>After consulting our customers, we have set service standards for when properties become empty. Our staff will make sure that each property meets these standards before they are re-let.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Making improvements to your home</h3>\n  <p>If you would like to make changes to, or improve your home (apart from decorating), you must get our written permission first, before any work starts.</p>\n  <p>Examples of improvements are:\u202f</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Fitting a new kitchen, bathroom, shower, gas fire or heating system.</li>\n    <li>Installing electrical sockets or new light fittings.</li>\n    <li>Fitting a new front door or windows.</li>\n    <li>Painting the outside of your home.</li>\n    <li>Putting up a shed or greenhouse or making a driveway or pavement crossing.</li>\n    <li>You cannot Artex your walls or fix polystyrene tiling to your ceilings.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>For a full list go to our\u202f<a href=\"#\">Tenant Improvement Guidelines</a>.</p>\n  <p>If you do undertake any improvements to your home, you will be responsible for maintaining new fixtures and fittings for 12 months. If your improvements were done by a private contractor they will normally be covered by a guarantee or manufacturer's warranty.</p>\n  <p>If you leave your home, you will be able to remove the new fittings, but we will charge you the full cost of putting the property right if you do not leave it in its original condition.</p>\n  <p>You can apply for our permission by downloading a\u202f<a href=\"#\">Home Improvement Application Form</a>. Once complete hand it in to your nearest customer information centre. If you have any problems, please contact us on 0345 600 6400.</p>\n  <p>If permission is granted, we will consult with you and let you know if there are any health and safety issues and whether any of the work requires special approval such as planning permission or building regulations. If we need to discuss it with you further, we will make an appointment with you.</p>\n  <p>If we refuse permission, we will give you an explanation why. Usually, permission is only refused if we consider the work would make the property unsafe or devalue it.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Compensation for Improvements</h3>\n  <p>All tenants have the right to compensation for improvements to their home (if they were started on or after 1st April 1994) when you leave your property. We will tell you at the time of application whether you qualify and will visit you during your 4 week notice period to give you advice and help towards your claim. You are unable to get compensation if you are buying your home through the Right to Buy scheme.</p>\n  <p>You can claim compensation for the cost of materials such as fixtures and fittings and reasonable labour costs. Compensation does not cover appliances such as cookers or fridges, or your own labour costs. Only improvements for which you have our full permission can be compensated.</p>\n  <p>You can claim a minimum of \u00a350 and up to a maximum of \u00a33,000 for each improvement you make. We may deduct money owed to us when your tenancy ends.</p>\n  <p>We can refuse your claim if you claim for an improvement you haven't made or claim for more than the correct amount.</p>\n  <p>If we refuse your claim, you have the right to appeal and should get advice from a solicitor or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Decorating your home</h3>\n  <p>Paint packs may be awarded to new tenants moving into empty properties (empty property service standards) or after certain kinds of minor repairs. Paint packs are also available if capital works are undertaken on your home. For full details, please call us on 0345 600 6400.</p>\n  <p>To make other improvements to your home read Home Improvement leaflet and our\u202f<a href=\"#\">Tenant Improvement Guidelines</a>.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Electrical safety &amp; testing</h2>\n  <p>When you take on a new tenancy, you may see a LET1 sign attached to the electric cupboard. If this is present, please contact us for an appointment.</p>\n  <p>Periodic electrical testing is also carried out on all Homes for Northumberland properties. You will receive a letter or telephone call to arrange an appointment when yours is due.</p>\n  <p>To find out more about electrical safety and testing, <a href=\"#\">click\u202fhere</a>.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Condensation &amp; damp</h2>\n  <p>There is always some moisture in the air, even if you cannot see it.</p>\n  <p>If the air gets colder, it cannot hold all the moisture and tiny drops of water appear. This is condensation.<br>\n  If your home is newly built it may be damp because the water used during its construction (for example, in plaster) is still drying out. It may take weeks of heating and ventilation to dry out.\u202fHiring a dehumidifier will help in the worst cases.</p>\n  <p>However, if you notice any of the following, please contact our customer services centre:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Leaking pipes, wastes or overflows.</li>\n    <li>Rain seeping through the roof where a tile or slate is missing.</li>\n    <li>Spilling from a blocked gutter.</li>\n    <li>Penetrating around window frames.</li>\n    <li>Leaking through a cracked pipe (these often leave a 'tide-mark').</li>\n    <li>Rising damp due to a defective damp-course or because there is no damp-course (rising damp only appears in ground floor rooms, and only to a maximum of 1m up a wall).</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><a href=\"#\">Click here</a> for more damp and condensation advice.<br>\n  To read our useful guide <a href=\"#\">click\u202fhere</a>.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Carbon monoxide</h2>\n  <h3>Heating appliances - the dangers</h3>\n  <p>Keeping warm is vital. Unfortunately, heating appliances are one of the most common causes of injury and death in the home.<br>\n  If users don't follow simple safety rules, heating appliances can kill.</p>\n  <h4>Carbon monoxide is deadly</h4>\n  <h5>What is it?</h5>\n  <p>Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas. It can be given off by any appliance that burns fossil fuels such as gas, coal, wood or oil, if they're not working properly, if the flue is blocked, or if the room is not properly ventilated.</p>\n  <h5>Why is it so dangerous?</h5>\n  <p>Carbon monoxide is odourless, colourless and tasteless, which makes it difficult to detect. However, its effects are deadly.</p>\n  <h5>What are the main causes of carbon monoxide poisoning?</h5>\n  <p>Most cases of carbon monoxide poisoning are due to inadequate ventilation, or poor maintenance of appliances, blocked chimneys or leaky flues.</p>\n  <p>Chimneys can become blocked for various reasons. It could be as a result of birds nesting on the chimney, or possible degradation of the flue. A blocked flue can lead to carbon monoxide leaking into your home, the occupants becoming drowsy, falling asleep, and not waking up again.</p>\n  <h5>Who is most at risk?</h5>\n  <p>Some people mistakenly think that it is only gas heating systems which can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. However, it can happen with any fossil fuel, if the system, which includes both the appliance and the flue, is faulty or the room is not properly ventilated. Some people only associate carbon monoxide poisoning with rented accommodation, in fact more people are killed in owner-occupied rather than rented properties.</p>\n  <p>Look out for the following danger signs:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The windows and doors have been draught-proofed and the permanent ventilation has been blocked up\u202fto prevent draughts so that the room is not properly ventilated.</li>\n    <li>There has been\u202fno regular maintenance of the appliance, like cleaning the throat plate monthly, or having the appliance serviced professionally.</li>\n    <li>The chimney and flue have not been swept for years.</li>\n    <li>The chimney or flue is blocked - watch out for smoke in the room.</li>\n    <li>There are soot deposits at the appliance outlet, or sooty stains appear on or just above appliances, regardless of the fuel being burnt.</li>\n    <li>The fire is difficult to light.</li>\n    <li>Gas flames that normally burn\u202fblue, burn orange or yellow instead.</li>\n    <li>Coal or wood fires burn slowly or go out.</li>\n    <li>You develop the following unexplained symptoms tiredness, drowsiness, headaches, dizziness, chest pains, nausea.\u202f</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Carbon monoxide detectors are available from Homes for Northumberland for our tenants. Please\u202f<a href=\"#\">contact us</a>\u202ffor more details.\u202f</p>\n  <p>For more information on carbon monoxide and safety tips and advice, <a href=\"#\">click\u202fhere</a>.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Asbestos safety</h2>\n  <p>If your property is more than 15 years old, it is possible that it contains materials made from asbestos.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Asbestos fibres are strong and resistant to heat and chemicals.</li>\n    <li>In the past, this led to their use in a wide range of building materials and products.</li>\n    <li>Properties built since the mid-1980s are very unlikely to contain asbestos in the fabric of the building.</li>\n    <li>Properties built after 1990 are extremely unlikely to contain asbestos anywhere in the building.</li>\n    <li>Asbestos cement has been widely used as a cladding material and can still be found in garages and sheds.</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h2>Rechargeable repairs</h2>\n  <p>You are required to conduct your tenancy in a tenant-like manner, taking reasonable care of your home both inside and out, carrying out some basic routine maintenance. You are required to:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Report any repairs as they arise to help minimise any damage that could get worse if unattended.</li>\n    <li>Allow us to get repairs done as quickly as possible.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Following consultation with tenants a definitive list of rechargeable repairs has been established, which identifies tenants' responsibilities\u202fas follows:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>repairing minor plaster cracks</li>\n    <li>internal decoration</li>\n    <li>TV aerials (except communal aerials)</li>\n    <li>loose screws on cupboards, windows, doors or gate furniture</li>\n    <li>washing machine installation</li>\n    <li>curtain rails</li>\n    <li>gaining entry to the property</li>\n    <li>external door locks</li>\n    <li>additional household keys</li>\n    <li>re-glazing windows</li>\n    <li>shower curtains and poles</li>\n    <li>laminate flooring</li>\n    <li>loose floor coverings and carpets</li>\n    <li>bolts or locks to outhouses or garden gates</li>\n    <li>coat rails or hooks</li>\n    <li>plugs and fuses for electrical appliances</li>\n    <li>light bulbs, fluorescent tubes and starters</li>\n    <li>batteries for smoke detectors</li>\n    <li>clothes posts</li>\n    <li>safety chains</li>\n    <li>doorbells</li>\n    <li>sink and bath plugs and chains</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h2>Gas safety</h2>\n  <p>Northumberland County Council directly employs its own gas engineers to ensure gas appliances in our properties are safe and efficient. Our gas engineers carry out periodic testing along with the regular safety tests as required by law.</p>\n  <p>You are required to conduct your tenancy in a tenant-like manner, taking reasonable care of your home both inside and out, carrying out some basic routine maintenance. You are required to:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Report any repairs as they arise to help minimise any damage that could get worse if unattended.",

      "letter": "To: CEO  \nFrom: Web Usability Manager  \nSubject: Recommendations for Improving Home Improvement Permission Process Based on Customer Feedback\n\nDear CEO,\n\nAfter analyzing the recent customer persona and feedback regarding our online services, I have identified opportunities to streamline our processes related to home improvement permission requests, which will enhance customer satisfaction, improve service efficiency, and reduce associated operational costs.\n\n**Current Situation and Feedback Summary**:  \nOur customer, David, a typical council tenant, exhibits familiarity with online platforms but finds that the current information on applying for permission to improve his flat is vague and lacks specific guidance. His feedback suggests that the process is not sufficiently transparent or accessible online. He is particularly concerned about delays and not knowing the progress of his application.\n\n**Key Issues Identified**:  \n- Lack of accessible, direct links to relevant forms and submission instructions.  \n- Absence of step-by-step guidance on how to initiate and complete the application process.  \n- No clear timelines or communication protocols post-application submission, creating uncertainty.\n\n**Recommended Improvements**:\n\n1. **Embed Clear, Actionable Links and Instructions**:  \nProvide direct URLs to the \"Home Improvement Application Form\" on our website, clearly labeled. For example:  \n_\"Download the Home Improvement Application Form from [Insert Link].\"_  \nInclude options for submitting online, via email, or in person at designated centres.\n\n2. **Develop a Step-by-Step Online Guide**:  \nCreate a dedicated online flowchart or FAQ section outlining each step from downloading the form, filling it out, submitting, and what to expect next. This can include:  \n- How to request the form  \n- Submission methods  \n- Expected review timelines  \n- Contact points for queries\n\n3. **Implement Automated Acknowledgement and Status Updates**:  \nAutomate email or SMS notifications to confirm receipt of applications and provide status updates, reducing the chance of missed communications and lowering call-centre workload.\n\n4. **Define and Communicate Clear Timelines**:  \nSpecify review periods (e.g., \"We will review your application within 10 working days\") and set expectations for decision-making and follow-up. This will reassure tenants, reduce follow-up inquiries, and minimize administrative overhead.\n\n**Impact on Customer Experience and Cost Savings**:  \nThese enhancements are likely to:\n- Significantly increase application transparency and tenant confidence.  \n- Reduce manual follow-up and administrative inquiries, saving time and resources.  \n- Shorten processing delays by encouraging corrections or complete applications upfront.  \n- Minimize association costs from missed or delayed communications.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nAdopting these targeted, user-centered improvements will not only enhance the tenant experience\u2014making the process more straightforward and trustworthy\u2014but also promote operational efficiency, ultimately resulting in cost reductions and better resource allocation for the council.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed implementation plan or further insights on integrating these enhancements.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nWeb Usability Expert"
