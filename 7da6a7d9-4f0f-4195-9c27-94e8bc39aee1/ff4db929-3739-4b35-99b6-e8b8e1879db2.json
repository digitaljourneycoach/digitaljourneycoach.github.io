      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nBased on the recent customer feedback and analysis of our web content related to flat improvement requests, I have identified key areas for enhancement that can significantly improve service efficiency and reduce operational costs.\n\nCustomer Persona & Needs:\nOur customer, David, exemplifies a typical tenant who is comfortable with digital processes and prefers straightforward, step-by-step guidance for small-scale requests such as installing a handrail or updating a kitchen. His primary concern is to receive timely updates and clarity on the approval process, which influences his overall experience and satisfaction.\n\nCurrent Feedback & Issues:\nDavid\u2019s feedback indicates that the existing webpage does not directly explain how to request permission for specific flat improvements. He finds the information too generic, with no tailored guidance for small modifications, and is uncertain whether the online forms mentioned are applicable. Additionally, he worries about delays and missing critical updates.\n\nThis results in potential user frustration, increased inquiry volume, and inefficient allocation of customer support resources. Moreover, ambiguity may lead tenants to avoid online channels altogether, increasing reliance on costly manual interventions.\n\nRecommendations & Improvements:\nTo address these issues and optimize our digital service delivery, I recommend developing a clear, step-by-step online guide specifically for tenants requesting minor improvements. This guide should include:\n\n1. **Tailored Step-by-Step Instructions:**  \n   - Explicitly confirm whether online forms can be used for small improvements like handrails or kitchen upgrades.  \n   - Provide a simple checklist of required documents and photos or plans to upload.  \n   - Clarify the typical timeframe for decisions and how tenants will be notified (email/SMS).\n\n2. **Progress Tracking Feature:**  \n   - Implement a system that allows tenants to track their application status online.  \n   - Send automatic updates at each stage (received, in review, decision made), reducing anxiety and inquiries.\n\n3. **Clear FAQ and Support Links:**  \n   - Include concise FAQs addressing common questions about small improvements, permissions, and process timelines.  \n   - Provide direct contact options if further clarification is needed.\n\nImpact of these improvements:\n- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Clear, tailored guidance will increase tenant understanding and satisfaction, encouraging continued use of digital services.  \n- **Operational Efficiency:** Reducing inbound queries about process steps will free up staff time for more complex cases, lowering service costs.  \n- **Faster Turnaround:** Automated updates and progress tracking will streamline decision-making, leading to quicker responses and higher tenant trust.\n\nBy implementing these enhancements, we can create a more user-centric online service that aligns with tenant expectations while reducing manual administrative effort, ultimately saving the council money and reinforcing our commitment to efficient public service.\n\nRespectfully,  \n[Web Manager Name]  \nUsability & Service Improvement Specialist"
