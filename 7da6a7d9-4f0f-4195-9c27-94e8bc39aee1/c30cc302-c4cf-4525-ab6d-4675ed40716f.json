      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nAfter reviewing the recent customer feedback and website analytics, it is clear that our current online service process, particularly regarding application requests for flat improvements, requires attention to enhance both user experience and operational efficiency.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- **Customer Persona & Needs:** David is a typical council tenant comfortable with online tools, seeking a straightforward process to request permission for small property modifications like installing a kitchen or handrail. He values clarity, simplicity, and timely updates.\n- **Feedback & Issues:** The customer encountered a 404 error page, which prevented access to vital information. The message displayed was vague and lacked actionable guidance such as direct links or contact details, resulting in user frustration and uncertainty.\n- **Impact:** These issues lead to wasted staff time handling inquiries that could have been managed through optimized digital channels, increasing operational costs and delaying tenant approvals.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Fix Broken Links & Ensure Content Accessibility:**  \n   Implement immediate technical steps to correct the broken page URL, and ensure that the relevant forms and guidance are accessible from primary navigation or search results. This directly reduces user frustration and support queries.\n\n2. **Develop Clear, Direct Landing Pages:**  \n   Create dedicated, user-friendly pages for flat improvement requests. These pages should feature:\n   - A simple online form allowing photo or plan uploads.\n   - Clear, step-by-step guidance on eligible improvements.\n   - Estimated timelines for decisions.\n   - Contact details for assistance.\n\n3. **Enhance Follow-Up & Communication:**  \n   Integrate automated email alerts or SMS notifications to keep tenants like David informed about application status updates. This reduces anxiety about delays and ensures tenants do not miss important information.\n\n4. **Improve Search Functionality & Navigation:**  \n   Make relevant pages more discoverable through optimized search terms and prominent links on the homepage. This encourages self-service and reduces inbound support queries, saving staff time and council funds.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n\n- Increased tenant satisfaction through seamless digital experiences.\n- Reduced administrative workload and resource allocation for support queries.\n- Faster processing times for approval requests, leading to better service delivery.\n- Cost savings associated with fewer support staff required to handle avoidable complaints.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing these usability issues will significantly enhance service efficiency, improve customer trust, and deliver cost efficiencies. I recommend prioritizing website content updates and technical fixes to create a more robust, user-centric online process.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Web Manager Name]  \nUsability & Digital Service Optimization Lead"
