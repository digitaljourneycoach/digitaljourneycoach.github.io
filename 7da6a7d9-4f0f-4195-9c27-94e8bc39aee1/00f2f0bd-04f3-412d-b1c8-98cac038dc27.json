      "letter": "To: CEO  \nFrom: Web Usability Manager  \nSubject: Recommendations for improving online flat improvement application process based on customer feedback\n\nDear CEO,\n\nAfter analyzing recent customer feedback and site data concerning the flat improvement application process for council tenants like David, I recommend targeted enhancements that will significantly improve user experience, increase process efficiency, and reduce operational costs.\n\n**Current Insights and Issues:**\n- The existing webpage currently lacks detailed, step-by-step guidance, making it difficult for tenants to understand the process.\n- There are no clear timelines or approval criteria communicated upfront, leading to uncertainty and anxiety among applicants.\n- Absence of direct links to online forms and explicit instructions on document uploads results in user errors and increased administrative follow-up.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n1. **Implement a Clear, Step-by-Step Online Guide:**  \n   Develop content that outlines each phase of the application, from submitting plans to approvals, with expected timeframes. For example, \"Complete the online form, upload your plans/photos, and expect a response within 10 working days.\"  \n   *Impact:* This transparency will reduce tenant worries, encourage self-service, and decrease staff inquiries, saving time and resources.\n\n2. **Add Direct Links and Instructions:**  \n   Integrate a prominent, easy-to-access link to the online application form and provide explicit instructions on required documents (photos, plans, etc.), including size and format specifications.  \n   *Impact:* Simplifies the application process, minimizes errors, and accelerates processing times, leading to cost savings.\n\n3. **Include Approval Criteria and Response Timelines:**  \n   Clearly specify what criteria are used for approval and update tenants about process milestones.  \n   *Impact:* Builds trust, reduces follow-up queries, and promotes more efficient case handling.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy implementing these improvements, the council\u2019s online service will become more user-centric, leading to higher satisfaction rates and fewer resource-intensive inquiries. This enhances service efficiency and has the potential to generate operational cost savings while fostering better tenant relationships.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to prepare a detailed rollout plan for these enhancements.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nWeb Usability Manager"
