      "letter": "Recommendation to the CEO from the Web Manager\n\nSubject: Enhancing Online Service Access for Council Tenants \u2013 Focused Improvements for Flat Improvement Requests\n\nOverview:\nThe recent user feedback and issue analysis reveal that our current webpage regarding requests for flat modifications is notably lacking in guidance and clarity. This has resulted in confusion, frustration, and a diminished trust in our digital services. Addressing these issues can significantly improve customer satisfaction, streamline the application process, and generate cost savings through reduced manual support.\n\nKey Findings:\n- The webpage content is currently empty, failing to provide essential instructions.\n- Users, like David, need clear, step-by-step guidance on applying for permission, permissible modifications, and timelines.\n- Lack of FAQs and contact details leaves tenants uncertain about next steps, potentially leading to repeated inquiries and manual interventions.\n- This gap negatively impacts user confidence and the overall efficiency of the council\u2019s service.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Develop and integrate comprehensive, user-friendly guidance content into the webpage:\n   - A clearly structured step-by-step application process.\n   - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) addressing common concerns.\n   - Clear outline of permissible improvements and restrictions.\n   - Expected timelines for decision-making.\n   - Contact details for direct support.\n\n2. Improve content visibility and accessibility:\n   - Use plain language, bullet points, and visual aids where appropriate.\n   - Ensure this information is prominent on the relevant page to prevent user frustration.\n\n3. Implement simple online forms with file upload capability for plans and photos:\n   - Enable tenants like David to submit requests seamlessly.\n   - Automate confirmation and status updates to alleviate worries about delays.\n\nImpact:\n- These enhancements will make the process more transparent and accessible, reducing the need for manual follow-up.\n- Faster and more confident submissions will improve tenant satisfaction.\n- Clear guidance will minimize errors and reduce the risk of tenants inadvertently breaching tenancy rules.\n- Over time, this will lead to operational cost savings through decreased administrative workload and fewer support calls.\n\nConclusion:\nBy prioritizing these targeted content and process improvements, we will advance our digital service quality, bolster tenant trust, and achieve efficiencies that benefit both our customers and the council\u2019s operations. Implementing these changes aligns with our commitment to user-centered design and cost-effective service delivery.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Web Manager\u2019s Name]\nUsability and Service Improvement Lead"
