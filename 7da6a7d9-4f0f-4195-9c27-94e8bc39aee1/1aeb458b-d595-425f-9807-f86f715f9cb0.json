      "body": "Tenancy agreement</h1>\n<p>Your rights and responsibilities as a tenant and our rights as your landlord.</p>\n\n<h2>Tenancy agreement consultation</h2>\n<p>We're updating our tenancy agreement, and we want everyone who lives in our Homes and Neighbourhoods properties to share their views on the proposed changes.</p>\n<p>Please note this consultation closes on Friday 9th May 2025.</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"#\">Proposed changes to your Tenancy Agreement April 2025</a>\n</p>\n<p>Completing this form take less than 5 minutes</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"#\">Share your feedback online</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>This document sets out the rights and responsibilities you have as a Kirklees Council tenant. By signing the tenancy agreement, you are legally bound to certain responsibilities in order for you to keep your tenancy. It also means that Kirklees Council, and Kirklees Neighbourhood Housing which acts as its agent, is legally bound by its responsibilities under the tenancy contract.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of tenancy</h2>\n<p>There are two main types of tenancy:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Introductory Tenancy</li>\n  <li>Secure Tenancy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Young people under the age of 18 will be set up on an equitable tenancy agreement, whether they are introductory or secure tenants.</p>\n\n<h3>Equitable tenancy agreement (under 18s)</h3>\n<p>If you are aged sixteen or seventeen years old (i.e. a minor) you will be set up on an Equitable Tenancy Agreement, whether your tenancy is \"INTRODUCTORY\" or \"SECURE\".</p>\n<p>In law, you cannot hold a tenancy in your own name until your 18th birthday so any tenancy that is set up, is held on trust by a responsible adult who acts as the \"trustee\".</p>\n<h4>Trustee responsibilities</h4>\n<p>When an Equitable Tenancy is set up, the trustee has to sign the Tenancy Agreement. The trustee has to be an adult who is able to act in your best interest. They will also be responsible for accepting any Notices or demands for payment served under this agreement.</p>\n<p>On your 18th birthday the tenancy automatically stops being an Equitable Tenancy and is either classed as an Introductory or Secure Tenancy depending on how long you have been the tenant and whether you have broken any conditions of your tenancy agreement. At this point, you no longer need a trustee and will hold the full legal title to your tenancy.</p>\n\n<h3>Introductory tenancies</h3>\n<p>We want everyone to enjoy the benefits of their tenancy and to live in peace in their homes. We know that the majority of our current tenants want this too. We are determined to do all we can to protect our tenants and the wider community from the distress and anxiety that anti-social behaviour and harassment can cause.</p>\n<h4>Trial period for new tenants</h4>\n<p>We give all new tenants a trial period of 12 months to show that they can keep to their tenancy agreement, look after their homes and garden areas, and do not cause a nuisance in their neighbourhoods. If you are transferring from another Kirklees Council property as a secure tenant, or if you are transferring as an assured tenant of a registered social landlord, such as a Housing Association, your tenancy will be secure straight away.</p>\n<h4>Responsibilities during introductory tenancy</h4>\n<p>During the introductory tenancy you must:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pay your rent on time, monthly, by the last day of the month.</li>\n  <li>Look after the property.</li>\n  <li>Not behave anti-socially, cause a nuisance or harass other people.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Monitoring and minor breaches</h4>\n<p>Our neighbourhood teams will closely monitor your introductory tenancy in its early stages. If minor nuisance or breaches of your tenancy come to our attention, we will offer you advice and give you the opportunity to change your behaviour.</p>\n<p>Such minor nuisances or breaches might include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>occasional noise</li>\n  <li>failure to look after your gardens to a satisfactory standard</li>\n  <li>minor damage to your property</li>\n  <li>nuisance caused by pets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Serious breaches and legal action</h4>\n<p>However, if we come across serious breaches of your tenancy or if you won't work with us to find a solution, we will take legal action to re-possess your home.</p>\n<p>Serious breaches that will cause us to take such action include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>harassment that has a major impact on victims or members of their family</li>\n  <li>violence or threats of violence</li>\n  <li>using the property for illegal or immoral purposes, for example drug dealing</li>\n  <li>escalating rent arrears with little or no intention of paying</li>\n  <li>continuation of a substantial number of minor incidents, despite warnings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to remember that you are not just responsible for your own behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning</strong><br>We will take action against you if the person causing anti-social behaviour is someone living with you or is a visitor to your home. It doesn't matter where the nuisance happens - in your home, outside or anywhere in the neighbourhood.</p>\n<h4>Rights of introductory tenants</h4>\n<p>You do not have some of the rights set out in this agreement during your introductory tenancy. As an introductory tenant you will have the following restricted rights:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>right to be consulted</li>\n  <li>right to have repairs carried out</li>\n  <li>right to succession.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will get these rights if you become a secure tenant:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>buy your home</li>\n  <li>assign or transfer your tenancy to someone else</li>\n  <li>take in lodgers or sublet your home</li>\n  <li>carry out improvements</li>\n  <li>mutually exchange your home with another tenant</li>\n  <li>transfer to another property (unless a serious housing need exists)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you become a secure tenant, you must still behave responsibly and keep to the rules of this agreement - but if we wanted to take possession of the property you would have the right to put your case at a court hearing. A judge would then decide if we could evict you. We would have to show that we have a valid reason to evict you. These are called 'grounds' and are defined by law. Before going to court we would have to serve you with a Notice of Seeking Possession, setting out which ground is being used and our reasons for serving the Notice.</p>\n<h4>Right of review</h4>\n<p>If notice is served on you for repossession of your home, you will be able to ask for a review of the decision. The review will be carried out by a manager or managers who have had no involvement in your case.</p>\n<h4>The role of the courts</h4>\n<p>Unless an introductory tenant has successfully appealed against the decision to repossess, the application will then proceed to Court. Provided that the Court is satisfied that the notice and review procedures have been followed correctly, possession must be granted to the landlord. Eviction from your home will follow.</p>\n<p>Make sure you have read and understood the information about introductory or equitable tenancies that came with your offer letter. It describes the procedure we have to go through if we want to evict you.</p>\n<p>Ask at your housing office or contact a housing officer if you have not seen a copy or if you have any questions.</p>\n<h4>Getting a secure tenancy</h4>\n<p>Once you have completed your introductory tenancy without any serious breaches, your tenancy will automatically change to a secure one with full statutory rights.</p>\n<p>You will then also become a member of KNH Excel. This is our reward and recognition scheme for loyal tenants. Benefits of the scheme include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>a discount card offering you substantial savings at local shops and businesses</li>\n  <li>entry into competitions and prize draws through Door to Door, our tenants magazine</li>\n  <li>access to community grants and good neighbour awards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>About your tenancy agreement</h4>\n<p>Some of the council's rights and responsibilities described in the following pages may be carried out by other agencies on its behalf, including enforcement of this agreement and recovery of any payments due.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Your tenancy agreement is a binding contract between you and us (the council).</li>\n  <li>It contains your rights and obligations as a tenant and our rights and obligations as your landlord.</li>\n  <li>Most council tenancies are legally known as secure tenancies unless you are an introductory tenant. This means that we can only end the tenancy if we get a court order. There are strict rules in the Housing Acts that control the circumstances in which the court will grant this type of order.</li>\n  <li>Under the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, we can apply to the courts to demote a secure tenancy to a less secure one for up to a year. We can do this when the behaviour of a tenant, family member or visitor is causing or threatening to cause nuisance or annoyance to someone who isn't a member of the household.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your tenancy is demoted, you will lose important rights enjoyed by secure tenants:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>right to buy or acquire</li>\n  <li>right to exchange</li>\n  <li>right to sublet, take in lodgers or improve the property</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any repetition of anti-social behaviour or rent arrears during the demoted tenancy can result in you losing your home.</p>\n\n<h3>Legal rights and obligations</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>As long as you pay your rent and you and your household follow the other terms of your tenancy agreement, we will not ask the court to make an order for possession, unless, for example, we need to move you to redevelop your home.</li>\n  <li>However, to be a secure tenant, you must live in the property as your only or principal (main) home. If you do not, we will be entitled to serve a 'notice to quit' on you and get possession of the property.</li>\n  <li>Both you and the council also have a number of legal rights and obligations which are set out by Acts of Parliament. For example, as a secure tenant, you have the right to:\n    <ul>\n      <li>pass on your tenancy when you die</li>\n      <li>exchange your tenancy with another secure tenant</li>\n      <li>buy your home, under the Right to Buy</li>\n      <li>repair your home, if we fail to do so</li>\n      <li>improve your home</li>\n      <li>receive compensation for some improvements when you leave</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Tenancy agreement</h2>\n<p>This is a tenancy agreement between us (Kirklees Council) and you (the Tenant), relating to the property described in the Schedule at the back. The main parts of this agreement are as follows.</p>\n\n<h3>Rent</h3>\n<h4>Rent payment direct debit</h4>\n<p>You must pay all rent, including any service charges, by direct debit. This is due on the first day of every month for the month to come. At the start of the tenancy, you must pay a fair proportion of the rent for the period from the start of the tenancy to the end of the month in which the tenancy started. You must not use any other method of payment.</p>\n<p>You must pay your rent by a monthly direct debit payment unless an arrangement has been made with Kirklees Council.</p>\n<h4>Changes to payment dates</h4>\n<p>You must tell us if you expect any changes to the date when we receive your payment. This includes any changes to your Direct Debit, benefits, or being moved onto Universal Credit.</p>\n<h4>Service charges</h4>\n<p>If it is a condition of the tenancy that you have to pay a service charge for the property; that service charge is part of the rent. This service charge will also be charged on a weekly basis. </p>\n<h4>Joint tenants responsibility</h4>\n<p>If you are joint tenants, you are both responsible for paying by direct debit all the rent and any arrears (rent you owe). If you have rent arrears, we can require any individual joint tenant to pay the money that is owed; we can also require any individual joint tenant to set up a direct debit to ensure that future rent payments are made on time. You are both responsible for ensuring that rent is paid by direct debit, even if one of you has left your home.</p>\n<p>To set up a direct debit, please call Phone 01484 414886<br>\n<a href=\"#\">Pay rent or set up a Direct Debit: Pay rent</a>.</p>\n<h4>Late payments</h4>\n<p>If we receive your direct debit payment later than the last day of the month, your account will show arrears.</p>\n<p>If you owe rent, we will give you support and debt counselling and make arrangements for you to pay the rent you owe. There is more information about how we can help in the Welcome to Your New Home. If you do not pay, we will take firm action that could lead to eviction.</p>\n<p>We would not normally consider re-housing you if you owe us any rent.</p>\n<h4>Additional service charges</h4>\n<p>Some tenants must pay a service charge on top of the basic rent for extra services they receive. The schedule to this agreement will tell you if this applies to you. These charges may include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Retirement living scheme service charge</li>\n  <li>Concierge service charge</li>\n  <li>Furnished-letting service charge</li>\n  <li>Communal heating charge</li>\n  <li>Communal cleaning charge</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Alternative payment frequency</h4>\n<p>Please contact us if you wish to apply for permission to pay your rent more frequently than once a month (for example every week or two weeks).</p>\n\n<h3>Repairs</h3>\n<h4>Council's repair responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>We (the council) are responsible for repairing the structure and the outside of your home and also for any systems that supply water, gas and electricity within your home.</li>\n  <li>We are also responsible for repairing any of our systems for heating your home or for providing hot water or sanitation (baths, sinks and toilets).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Tenant's repair responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>You are responsible for decorating the inside of your home, anything that we are not responsible for and also for items which you own or have put in.</li>\n  <li>You must report any repairs that are needed that we are responsible for as soon as you notice them.</li>\n  <li>We will send you a series of texts (or a written receipt upon request) to confirm the details of the repair.</li>\n  <li>If the repair cannot be authorised by the contractor they will arrange for an inspection by a KNH surveyor.</li>\n  <li>You are responsible for any damage to your home caused by you, your family or your visitors. You must pay us for any damage.</li>\n  <li>You must use your home properly and responsibly. You must keep all grates, grids, drains and gullies (not including gutters that catch water from the roof) clean and clear, and you must take care not to block toilets and sinks.</li>\n  <li>You must not alter your home without our written permission.</li>\n  <li>You must not remove any items we own from your home, or from any other property we own, without our written permission.</li>\n  <li>Following a mutual exchange with another tenant, you will be responsible for the decoration that the previous tenant has left. We will repair any damage caused by the previous tenant and charge them for it. You will also be responsible for any improvements or alterations that the previous tenant did, unless we agree to be responsible for them. Introductory tenants do not have the right for a mutual exchange. You get this right if you become a secure tenant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any officers or contractors who call at your home in relation to repairs or other housing matters must carry identity cards.</p>\n<p>During repair work, we will try to cause as little damage as possible to your decorations. However, if we do cause any damage during repair work (if that repair work was not your fault), you may be entitled to an allowance to redecorate.</p>\n<p>The Housing Act 1985 gives secure tenants the right to be consulted on a number of matters including managing, maintaining and improving their homes. We have set out a framework for consulting our tenants in our current Tenants Participation Charter. You can get a copy of this from your housing office.</p>\n<h4>Regular maintenance</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>We will regularly paint the outside of your home and shared areas.</li>\n  <li>We will make sure we have removed our rubbish, building materials and equipment from your home after we have finished the repair work.</li>\n  <li>We will repair all entrances, halls, stairways, lifts, rubbish chutes, lighting and other common parts of all blocks of flats and maisonettes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compensation for repairs</h4>\n<p>Under Section 96 of the Housing Act 1985 we will pay compensation for certain repairs if we do not do them within a certain time, depending on certain conditions. Your housing office can give you more details.</p>\n<p>Under Section 97 of the Housing Act 1985, you have a right to carry out your own alterations or improvements, but you must get permission, in writing, from your housing office. You may also get compensation for this work when you end your tenancy. Introductory tenants do not have this right. You get this right if you become a secure tenant.</p>\n\n<h4>Notes- repairs</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Decorating responsibilities:</strong>\n    <ul>\n      <li>You are responsible for decorating the inside of your home. This includes repairing minor cracks in plaster work and preparing surfaces so they can be painted or papered.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Additional responsibilities:</strong>\n    <ul>\n      <li>changing locks if you lose your keys</li>\n      <li>replacing lost or broken keys",

While comprehensive, this dense information is unlikely to directly facilitate the quick application David needs, especially given his desire for simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Feedback and Issues:**\n- The absence of explicit, action-oriented deadlines reduces a sense of urgency among users.\n- Grammatical inaccuracies (e.g., \"Completing this form take less than 5 minutes\") can undermine professional tone and clarity.\n- Fragmented instructions (e.g., confusing sentences about payment changes) may cause user frustration or missteps.\n\n**Recommended Improvements:**\n\n1. **Clear, Actionable Deadlines & Instructions:**\n   - **Implement** prominent notices with specific deadlines, e.g., \u201cSubmission closes on Friday, 9th May 2025. Please submit your feedback before this date.\u201d\n   - **Impact:** Creating a sense of urgency encourages timely user action, reducing delays in processing applications and minimizing manual follow-ups, ultimately saving staff time and council resources.\n\n2. **Grammar and Clarity Enhancements:**\n   - **Correct** grammatical errors, such as changing \u201ctake\u201d to \u201ctakes,\u201d to maintain professionalism.\n   - **Impact:** Clear, professional language reduces misunderstandings, leading to fewer inquiries and re-submissions, optimizing administrative efficiency.\n\n3. **Streamlined and Consolidated Instructions:**\n   - **Revise** complex and fragmented sentences into cohesive, straightforward directives. For instance:\n     - Original: \u201cIf you expect any changes to the date when we receive your payment. This includes any changes to your Direct Debit, benefits, or being moved onto Universal Credit.\u201d  \n     - Improved: \u201cIf you expect any changes to the date we receive your payment\u2014such as changes to your Direct Debit, benefits, or transfers to Universal Credit\u2014please inform us.\u201d\n   - **Impact:** Simplifies user experience, reduces error rates in submissions, and decreases technician intervention.\n\n4. **Enhanced Digital Form Design:**\n   - **Create** a dedicated, user-friendly online application form for permissions like flat modifications and upload options for images or plans.\n   - **Impact:** By making forms straightforward and accessible, we can increase online completion rates, reducing reliance on postal correspondence and decreasing administrative overhead.\n\n5. **Automated Notifications & Progress Updates:**\n   - **Introduce** automated email or SMS updates regarding application status, decision timelines, and required actions.\n   - **Impact:** Addresses David\u2019s concern about delays and missed updates, improving satisfaction and trust, which can reduce customer service inquiries.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy focusing on clear deadlines, professional language, and user-centric digital tools, we can significantly enhance the customer journey. Improved clarity and communication will lead to higher online engagement, faster application processing, and reduced manual workload\u2014ultimately saving the council money and enhancing service delivery.\n\nI recommend prioritizing these incremental but impactful improvements to align our digital services with tenant expectations and operational efficiency goals.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Web Manager\u2019s Name]  \nUsability & Digital Services Lead"
