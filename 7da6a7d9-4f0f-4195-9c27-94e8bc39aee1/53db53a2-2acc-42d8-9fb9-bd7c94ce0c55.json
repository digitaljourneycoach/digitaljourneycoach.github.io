If you're a secure tenant or leaseholder of a Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council property and want to make alterations to your home, you must get the council's consent before starting any works, otherwise you could face serious consequences including legal action.</p>\n<p>Fixed term tenants cannot make any alterations.</p>\n<p>You may also need licences for scaffolding and skips on council land, party wall notices, and other matters such as rights to light, crane over-sailings and agreements with utility companies.</p>\n\n<h2>Getting consent to make alterations</h2>\n<p>How to get landlord's consent to make alterations.</p>\n<p>If you're a secure tenant or leaseholder of a Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council building and want to make alterations to your home, you must get the council's permission before starting any works.</p>\n<p>This is part of your lease or tenancy agreement. If you don't keep to it, you could face serious consequences including legal action. If you make alterations without consent, you could also have problems if you decide to sell the property, exchange it or buy it under the right to buy scheme.</p>\n<p>'Landlord's consent' is not the same as planning consent or building regulations consent, which you may also need. <a href=\"https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/planning\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about more on planning consent and building regulations approval</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Consent for minor alterations</h3>\n<p>Internal non-structural works which don't require Building Regulation approval or planning permission is called a minor alteration. To make minor alterations, you must apply for a landlord's consent to alterations and the council will consider whether it would be possible to issue a letter licence.</p>\n\n<h3>Consent for major alterations</h3>\n<p>Works requiring Building Regulation approval or planning permission is called a major alteration. Examples include loft extensions, excavation of basements and extensions into the garden. To make major alterations, you must apply for a full licence.</p>\n<p>To apply, please complete the relevant form.

You aren't allowed to build on any communal ground shared with other building users.</p>\n<p>Leases don't include loft spaces. To do any work or use the loft area, you would need to apply to buy it from us. It's the council's decision whether to sell you the space or grant a licence. You should consult with your neighbours before contacting us as any objections could affect our decision.</p>\n<p>Your extension must not make it difficult for the council to access, maintain and repair the external parts of the building to which the extension is attached. This means that:-</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The extension needs to incorporate a suitable base for long term loads of up to class 4 scaffold (for major maintenance works)</li>\n  <li>The extension needs to provide a suitable base for tower scaffold (for day to day responsive repairs)</li>\n  <li>The extension should not result in the future need for especially designed scaffolds with a volume significantly in excess of that which would otherwise have been necessary</li>\n  <li>The extension must incorporate clearly and permanently marked loading points (so that future maintenance and repair contractors can identify where it is safe to support a scaffold)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless you can demonstrate by providing structural calculations and details that the intended extension design incorporates the above requirements the application may not be accepted.</p>\n<p>For more information about buying your loft space or any development rights to excavate basements or erect extensions into your garden, please see <a href=\"https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/housing/home-buy/leaseholder-aftersales\" target=\"_blank\">leaseholder aftersales</a> or contact H&amp;F Homebuy on 020 8753 6464 or <a href=\"mailto:handfhomebuy@lbhf.gov.uk\">handfhomebuy@lbhf.gov.uk</a></p>\n\n<h2>Getting retrospective consent</h2>\n<h3>What should I do if I've made changes to my home without getting landlord's consent?</h3>\n<p>If you've already done works without obtaining consent, you must get in contact with us immediately. Failure to do so may result in legal proceedings. You'll need to apply for retrospective consent. We may grant you a licence for retrospective consent if the work that's been done meets certain criteria and workmanship standards. We'll assess your application and decide whether we can grant consent. We may ask you to carry out additional work, remove or reinstate recent work before we can give you retrospective consent.</p>\n<p>To apply, please complete the relevant form.

      "letter": "To: CEO  \nFrom: Web Usability & Service Efficiency Lead  \nSubject: Recommendations for Improving Council Tenant Information Pages Based on Customer Feedback and Issue Review\n\nDear [CEO Name],\n\nAfter reviewing the recent customer feedback and issues identified in the JSON data concerning the Council Tenant - David's experience and the related page content, I have formulated targeted recommendations to enhance usability, service efficiency, and ultimately, cost savings for the council.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**  \n- The feedback indicates that the current information is comprehensive but somewhat complex, leading to difficulty in quickly understanding the process. Customers like David seek clear, step-by-step guidance to minimize confusion, delays, and errors.  \n- Specific issues identified include the need for simplified summaries, visual aids like flowcharts, and quick checklists to assist users in navigating procedural complexities without frustration.  \n- Addressing these issues will facilitate smoother customer interactions, reduce inbound queries for clarification, and decrease administrative overhead.\n\n**Recommended Improvements:**\n\n1. **Introduce a Clear, Concise Summarized Overview/Highlights at the Beginning:**  \n   *What:* A brief paragraph or bullet points at the top of the page summarizing essential requirements\u2014e.g., \"You need a license if you plan to place scaffolding, skips, or materials on council land or affect council property.\"  \n   *Impact:* Enables customers to quickly determine if they need to proceed further, reducing unnecessary page visits or calls.  \n\n2. **Implement Visual Aids such as Flowcharts or Step-by-Step Guides:**  \n   *What:* Create simple flowcharts illustrating the sequence of actions needed\u2014for example, serving party wall notices or applying for licenses.  \n   *Impact:* Visual processing reduces cognitive load, making complex procedures easily understandable and encouraging self-service. Furthermore, this reduces staff time spent explaining procedures, saving costs.  \n\n3. **Add Quick-Reference Checklists or Bullet Point Summaries:**  \n   *What:* For each process, include a straightforward checklist of key steps and required documents.  \n   *Impact:* Facilitates faster decision-making by users, minimizes errors or omissions, and expedites processing times\u2014leading to operational efficiencies.  \n\n4. **Develop Interactive or Downloadable Templates and Guides:**  \n   *What:* Offering downloadable PDFs or interactive forms embedded within the page that follow the simplified process flow.  \n   *Impact:* Empowers customers to progress independently with confidence, reduces support requests, and encourages more online completions.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nImplementing these usability enhancements aligns with our goal of improving service accessibility and reducing administrative costs. By decreasing ambiguity and streamlining customer interactions, we can reduce the volume of clarification queries, lower processing times for applications, and decrease the likelihood of costly errors or legal issues stemming from misunderstandings.\n\nIn conclusion, these improvements will significantly enhance user experience for council tenants like David, promoting faster, clearer, and more efficient interactions\u2014ultimately furthering our mission to deliver high-quality, cost-effective services.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like a detailed plan for implementation or examples of revised page layouts.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nWeb Usability & Service Efficiency Lead"
