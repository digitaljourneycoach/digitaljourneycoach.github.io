The property should be safe and secure, free from disrepair or damage, heated and dry. All repairs to the property should be carried out before the tenant moves in. If you have a mortgage on the property, you must obtain permission from your lender before letting the property. Further advice can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renting-out-a-property\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gov.uk</a> website.</p>\n\n<h2>What tenancy should I use?</h2>\n<p>Once a tenant is found you must compile an inventory of the content and condition of the property. The tenant will need to confirm they agree with the content of the inventory. Both parties will need to keep a copy as it may be necessary to refer to these documents, if there are any disagreements during the tenancy.</p>\n\n<h2>Assured Shorthold Tenancies</h2>\n<p>Assured Shorthold tenancies are the most common type of rental agreement. It provides a landlord with rights and responsibilities. It will hopefully create a positive relationship between you and your tenant.

Landlords and letting agents can face a civil penalty if found guilty of illegally renting a property, with fines up to \u00a33,000. Advice on how to check if a tenant or lodger can rent your residential property can be found on the website: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gov.uk \u2013 Landlords right to rent checks guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What\u2019s the rule on Pets?</h2>\n<p>The suggested model agreement prohibits the tenant from keeping pets in the property, without the landlord's consent. However, you must not be unreasonable. You cannot exercise a blanket ban on pets or should not turn down a request without good reason. For example; a landlord may consider a large dog would be reasonably likely to damage the property, whereas a smaller pet may not. If you consent to allow a pet, you may wish an additional deposit is paid by the tenant. This must be protected within an authorised tenancy deposit scheme.</p>\n\n<h2>Information you must provide to your tenant before they move in</h2>\n<p>Before a tenant moves in you must provide them with the following items.
