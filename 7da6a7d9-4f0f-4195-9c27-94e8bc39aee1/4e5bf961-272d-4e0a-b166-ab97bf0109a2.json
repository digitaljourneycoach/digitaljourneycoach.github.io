      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nBased on the recent user feedback and analysis of the customer persona, I recommend targeted usability improvements to enhance our online service for council tenants like David, as well as to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- The customer, David, is a digitally capable council tenant seeking straightforward online processes for flat modifications.\n- Current webpage content is insufficient; the page is empty and provides no guidance or actionable steps.\n- Feedback indicates confusion and frustration due to a lack of information, process clarity, and no direct links to the necessary forms.\n- Concerns about delays and updates are prevalent, emphasizing the importance of transparent communication channels.\n\n**Positive Feedback & Recognition:**\n\nWhile the service currently falls short technically, the feedback emphasizes a desire for clarity and simplicity. This demonstrates our tenants\u2019 willingness to engage digitally if provided with clear instructions and accessible tools. I commend the web team for recognizing these gaps and being receptive to improvements.\n\n**Recommended Improvements & Benefits:**\n\n1. **Populate the Webpage with Clear, Actionable Content:**\n   - Include a direct link to the online application form for flat modifications.\n   - Provide step-by-step instructions outlining the process (e.g., fill form \u2192 upload plans/photos \u2192 wait for approval).\n   - Clearly specify what supporting documents are needed and acceptable formats.\n   - State expected response times (e.g., \u201cDecisions will be made within four weeks\u201d) to set proper expectations.\n\n2. **Implement User-Friendly Features:**\n   - Add FAQs explaining common concerns related to delays, updates, and potential risks.\n   - Introduce automated email or SMS notifications for status updates to address tenants' worries about delays and communication gaps.\n\n3. **Technical and Content Enhancements:**\n   - Ensure the webpage is mobile-friendly, given the tenant\u2019s comfort with smartphones.\n   - Develop a simple, intuitive online form to reduce barriers to submission.\n\n**Expected Impact:**\n\nImplementing these improvements will enhance the user experience significantly by making the application process transparent and accessible, reducing user confusion and frustration. Efficient digital forms decrease administrative time and costs, free up staff resources, and reduce the reliance on postal correspondence, driving cost savings. Furthermore, clear communication about process timelines and updates will improve tenant satisfaction and trust, fostering a more positive relationship with our council services.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA focus on content clarity, actionable links, and communication transparency aligns with our goal to deliver efficient, user-centered online services. These enhancements will streamline requests, decrease follow-up inquiries, and generate cost efficiencies\u2014all while elevating the overall tenant experience.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]  \nWeb Usability & Service Improvement Lead"
