      "letter": "To the CEO:\n\nSubject: Recommendations for Improving Customer Experience and Increasing Service Efficiency\n\nBased on the recent analysis of the customer persona, feedback, and issues encountered by users like David, our primary goal should be to simplify and clarify the process for requesting permission to make small improvements to council flats.\n\n**Current Findings:**\n- The existing webpage predominantly discusses building regulation charges, which does not directly address the main concern: how tenants can easily request permission, upload supporting documents, and receive timely updates.\n- Customer feedback indicates a need for a straightforward, step-by-step guide that includes clear instructions, direct links or online forms, and estimated timelines.\n- The lack of an easily accessible online self-service option contributes to user frustration and potential delays, which could increase administrative workload and associated costs.\n\n**Specific Recommendations:**\n1. **Develop a dedicated online request form for flat improvements** that guides tenants through each step:\n   - Clear instructions on what information to upload (photos, plans).\n   - Options to track application status and receive updates automatically via email or SMS.\n   - Estimated timelines for decision-making, such as approval within a specified number of days.\n\n2. **Create a unified landing page** that succinctly explains the process:\n   - Start with a simple overview.\n   - Include direct links to the online form.\n   - Provide FAQs addressing common concerns about delays, decision times, and compliance.\n\n3. **Integrate automated notifications** to keep tenants informed throughout the process, reducing the need for manual follow-up and improving transparency.\n\n**Positive Impact:**\n- Making the process more intuitive will likely decrease inbound queries, freeing staff time and reducing administrative costs.\n- Enhanced transparency and ease of use can increase tenant satisfaction, potentially reducing complaint handling.\n- Automating updates and streamlining requests will improve service efficiency and help the Council meet modern digital standards, reflecting a forward-thinking approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nImplementing these improvements could significantly enhance user satisfaction, reduce service delivery costs, and position the Council as a leader in accessible digital services. I recommend prioritizing the development of this online permission request pathway and revising related content to focus on the user journey, thus aligning our digital offerings with tenant needs.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]  \nWeb Usability & Service Improvement Lead"
