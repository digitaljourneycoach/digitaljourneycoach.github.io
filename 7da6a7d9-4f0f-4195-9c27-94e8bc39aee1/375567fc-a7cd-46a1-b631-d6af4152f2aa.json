      "letter": "To: CEO\n\nSubject: Recommendations for Enhancing Flat Improvement Application Process to Improve Customer Experience and Operational Efficiency\n\nDear CEO,\n\nBased on recent customer feedback and usability analysis of our current online guidance for flat improvement requests, I recommend targeted enhancements to streamline the process, reduce confusion, and improve satisfaction even within our existing system.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nThe primary concern among users like David, a council tenant seeking simple modifications such as installing a handrail or kitchen, is the lack of clear, straightforward guidance tailored to small-scale improvements. Currently, the instructions emphasize formal planning applications that are suited for large projects, which can intimidate or confuse residents making minor requests.\n\nWhile the existing online form facilitates submissions, the process appears too generic and does not explicitly account for simple changes, leading to uncertainties about whether prior permission is necessary, the exact steps, and how long approval might take. This can cause delays and frustration\u2014potentially leading tenants to seek alternative, less efficient channels.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\n\n1. **Clear Guidance for Small Modifications:**\n   - Develop a dedicated, easily accessible section within the online portal specifically for small-scale flat modifications (e.g., installing handrails, small kitchen upgrades).\n   - Include step-by-step instructions clarifying:\n     - When permission is required versus when it isn't.\n     - That simple online forms can often be used for straightforward changes.\n     - The typical timeline for decisions, e.g., 2 weeks for online submissions vs. 4-6 weeks for paper forms.\n     - The ability to upload photos or plans directly for review.\n\n2. **Streamlined Online Forms:**\n   - Create a simplified, user-friendly online form for minor improvements with predefined guidance, reducing the need for additional documentation or complex application procedures.\n   - Implement prompts that automatically reassure users about permissions and timelines based on their inputs.\n\n3. **Improve Communication and Updates:**\n   - Send automatic updates via email or SMS at key stages\u2014acknowledgment of submission, decision, and any additional info needed.\n   - Provide clear decision timelines upfront to manage tenant expectations and reduce follow-up inquiries.\n\n**Impact on Customer Experience and Operations:**\n\n- **Enhanced Satisfaction and Trust:** Simplifying the process and providing transparent timelines will increase tenants\u2019 confidence in our service, reducing anxiety about delays or errors.\n  \n- **Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings:** Clear guidance and quicker online approvals can reduce staff time spent handling basic inquiries, decrease paperwork, and expedite decision-making, thereby saving council resources.\n\n- **Reduced Administrative Burden:** Automating communications and clarifications will lessen manual intervention and foster self-service among tenants.\n\nIn summary, by tailoring our guidance and forms to address small flat modifications explicitly, we can significantly improve tenant experience, streamline approvals, and optimize resource allocation across our housing services.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed plan or mockups to proceed with implementation.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Web Manager Name]  \nUsability and Service Optimization Lead"
