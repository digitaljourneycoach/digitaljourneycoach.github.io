      "letter": "To: CEO  \nFrom: Web Usability Manager  \nSubject: Recommendations for Improving Online Flat Improvement Requests Based on Customer Feedback\n\nDear [CEO Name],\n\nAfter reviewing the recent customer persona, feedback, and identified issues regarding the process for requesting permissions to make improvements to council flats, I have identified key areas where targeted enhancements can significantly improve service efficiency and customer satisfaction while concurrently reducing administrative costs.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nThe primary issue is a lack of clear, accessible guidance on the webpage dedicated to flat improvement requests. While the customer, David\u2014who is comfortable using online tools\u2014expresses a desire for a simple, step-by-step process, the current webpage is empty and offers no instructions or resources. Feedback indicates that users are confused about the application steps, approval times, and permitted modifications, which leads to dissatisfaction and potential delays in processing.\n\n**Recommended Actions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Develop a Clear, Step-by-Step Online Guide:**  \n   Create a dedicated, easily accessible section on the webpage that outlines the entire process \u2014 from initiating an application to receiving approval. This guide should include explicit instructions, estimated decision timelines, and permitted modifications.\n\n2. **Integrate Direct Links and Resources:**  \n   Incorporate prominent links to the online form, downloadable plans or photos upload instructions, and contact information. Ensuring users can quickly find all necessary tools reduces follow-up inquiries and manual interventions.\n\n3. **Communicate Process Duration and Permitted Changes Clearly:**  \n   By explicitly stating how long approvals typically take and what alterations are allowed, we enhance user trust and reduce uncertainty, leading to fewer support calls and appeals.\n\n4. **Ensure Content is Mobile-Friendly and Simple:**  \n   Since David prefers a straightforward digital experience on his smartphone, the content should be concise, with minimal steps and user-friendly language.\n\n**Impact of These Improvements:**\n\nImplementing these enhancements will streamline the application process, making it faster and more transparent. This reduces administrative overhead by decreasing inquiries and follow-up communications, ultimately saving the council money. Additionally, a clear online pathway encourages more tenants to use digital services, decreasing reliance on paper-based processes and postal communication, further increasing efficiency and environmental sustainability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy addressing the current gaps with targeted, user-centric upgrades, we can significantly improve the service experience for tenants like David, increase process transparency, and realize cost savings through reduced staff workload and improved digital adoption.\n\nI recommend prioritizing these improvements to enhance our online service offerings and to continue building a reputation for responsive, accessible council services.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nWeb Usability Manager"
