If this happens, we will do our best to arrange temporary accommodation which suits your needs and will try to offer similar property in an area of your choice. We will make a reasonable offer based on what is available.<br>\n  Whatever happens, you will not be charged any additional rent on top of what you were paying, and you might be entitled to a disturbance allowance.</p>\n  <h3>Your feedback</h3>\n  <p>We will ask for your feedback once a repair or planned maintenance is completed. We, or the contractor, will invite you to rate the service you received and ask for any suggestions.</p>\n\n  <h2>Our repairs contractors</h2>\n  <p>We have two main building repairs contractors and one gas repairs contractor.

All our contractors adopt apprentice employment schemes to encourage the development and growth of their staff.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Mountjoy \u2013 repairs for PO1 to PO5 properties, however they will work across areas, out of hours. <a href=\"https://www.mountjoy.co.uk/\">Visit the Mountjoy website.</a></li>\n    <li>Comserv \u2013 repairs for our PO6 and PO7 properties \u2013 however they will work across areas, out of hours. <a href=\"https://comserv.org.uk/\">Visit the Comserv website.</a></li>\n    <li>Liberty \u2013 for gas repairs, servicing, and annual gas certification for all our properties. <a href=\"https://www.liberty-group.co.uk/\">Visit the Liberty website.</a></li>\n    <li>Corrigenda and other contractors and sub-contractors \u2013 for all things mechanical and electrical, in our communal areas.</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h2>If you want to make alterations to your council property</h2>\n  <p>As time moves on, you may wish to make changes to your home, for example altering the layout of your living space. Generally, the council is quite happy to approve any home improvement work that you plan to do.<br>\n  However, some work needs planning permission or building control approval. So, to make sure you don\u2019t do anything we\u2019d object to, you must first contact us to get written approval before you start.</p>\n  <p>Here are some examples of home improvements you must contact us about in advance:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>altering windows, doors or doorways</li>\n    <li>fitting a satellite dish, CB or TV aerial</li>\n    <li>installing central heating, a new kitchen or bathroom suite</li>\n    <li>dividing rooms</li>\n    <li>removing internal walls or chimney breasts</li>\n    <li>decorating the outside of your home</li>\n    <li>building an extension</li>\n    <li>erecting a garage or car port, or laying a hard standing</li>\n    <li>erecting a garden shed or greenhouse</li>\n    <li>removing trees or hedges</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>If inappropriate or unsafe work is carried out without our approval, we can force you to reverse it \u2013 so it makes sense to be sure about what you are doing before you start.</p>\n\n  <h2>Documents</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Condensation-and-mould-advice-for-tenants-2023.pdf\">Condensation and mould - advice for tenants 2023</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</main>\n"
