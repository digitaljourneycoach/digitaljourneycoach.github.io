If you do not pay, we will have the work done and recharge you.</p>\n\n<h2>If permission is given to make changes</h2>\n<p>Once you have all the right permissions, you can go ahead with the work. Depending on the scale of improvements, we may want to inspect your home before and after. You are responsible for repairing and maintaining any home improvement you make.</p>\n<p>If you get a contractor to do the work, make sure the contractor has disposed of the rubbish correctly. Fly-tipping is a crime. If you are doing the work, dispose of your waste properly.</p>\n\n<h2>If permission to make changes is refused</h2>\n<p>Permission to make changes will be refused if we have a good reason. We normally prevent changes if the work will affect the safety of your building, cause a future problem with maintenance of the property, or cause nuisance to your neighbour/s.</p>\n<p>Refusals are communicated to you in writing, either by post or email. If you disagree with our decision or the conditions we have attached, you can appeal in a letter to us.</p>\n"

      "letter": "Dear CEO,\n\nAs the usability lead responsible for enhancing our online service experience, I have reviewed the customer persona, feedback, and current web content related to applying for permission to make changes to council flats. Based on this analysis, I recommend targeted improvements to streamline the process, improve user understanding, and reduce administrative burdens, ultimately resulting in cost savings and better service efficiency.\n\nObservation and Insights:\n- The customer persona, David, is comfortable with digital interfaces and values clear, step-by-step guidance that minimizes uncertainty.\n- The existing content communicates necessary legal and procedural information effectively but contains areas where clarity and user engagement can be significantly improved.\n- The current feedback indicates that the instructions are sometimes passive or complex, which may cause confusion or hesitation among users like David.\n\nRecommended Improvements:\n1. Enhance Call-to-Action Clarity:\n- Replace passive instructions such as \"Download the request permission to make a change to your council home form\" with a direct call-to-action, e.g., \"Download the Permission Request Form.\"\n- Impact: Clear, actionable prompts improve user comprehension and reduce the likelihood of incomplete or incorrect submissions, decreasing follow-up queries and administrative overhead.\n\n2. Simplify and Clarify Language:\n- Rephrase \"Changes you must ask us for permission for include\" to \"Changes that require our permission include:\"\n- Impact: Simplified language reduces cognitive load, encouraging timely customer engagement and decreasing support requests.\n\n3. Emphasize the Process:\n- Add guidance such as \"Before starting any work, ensure you have obtained all necessary permissions. You can check the requirements here [link].\"\n- Impact: Encourages customers to verify permissions early, preventing unauthorized work and potential costly rework or legal issues.\n\n4. Incorporate Progress Indicators and FAQs:\n- Introduce visual cues showing processing stages or estimated timelines, and quick links to common questions.\n- Impact: Increases customer confidence, reduces anxiety about delays, and streamlines communication, cutting down on customer service inquiries.\n\nSummary:\nImplementing these targeted refinements will make the application process more intuitive for users like David, encouraging correct and complete submissions the first time. This will reduce manual intervention and administrative costs, improve service turnaround times, and enhance the overall satisfaction of our tenants.\n\nI recommend prioritizing these usability enhancements on our platform to support our commitment to accessible, efficient, and cost-effective services.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability Lead"
