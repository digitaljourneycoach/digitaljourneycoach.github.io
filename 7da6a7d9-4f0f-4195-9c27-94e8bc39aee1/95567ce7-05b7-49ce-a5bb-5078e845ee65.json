      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nBased on our recent review of the customer persona, site content, feedback, and identified issues, I recommend targeted improvements to enhance service efficiency, improve user satisfaction, and potentially reduce operational costs.\n\nCustomer Persona & Needs:\nDavid, a typical council tenant aged 52, uses online services comfortably but prefers clear, straightforward digital interactions. His primary goal is to apply for permission to make small improvements to his flat, such as installing a kitchen or handrail. He is concerned about delays and missing updates, indicating a need for transparent, timely communication.\n\nCurrent Page Content & Feedback:\nThe page titled \"Building work - check the approval you need\" contains vital information about planning and building regulation permissions. However, feedback has identified clarity issues, particularly with headings, sentence structure, and resource accessibility.\n\nSpecific Issues & Recommendations:\n\n1. Heading Clarity:\n- Issue: The current heading (\"Building work - check the approval you need\") is somewhat generic.\n- Improvement: Change to \"How to get approval for your flat improvements.\"\n- Impact: A specific, action-oriented heading immediately informs users of the page\u2019s purpose, increasing engagement and reducing confusion.\n\n2. Sentence Structure & Readability:\n- Issue: The sentence \"Before you make improvements always check if you need planning permission, building regulation approval or both\" is lengthy and complex.\n- Improvement: Break it into shorter sentences: \"Before making improvements, check if you need planning permission, building regulation approval, or both.\"\n- Impact: Improved clarity and quicker comprehension, helping users determine their next steps more efficiently.\n\n3. Resource Linking & Accessibility:\n- Issue: The link to additional resources is embedded in text, which may reduce visibility.\n- Improvement: Replace with a prominent, clickable button or clearly labeled link, such as \"Learn more about building control approvals.\"\n- Impact: Increased accessibility and user engagement, leading to more informed customers who can complete their processes faster and with less frustration.\n\nOverall, refining language clarity, enhancing navigation cues, and streamlining information presentation will directly benefit users like David\u2014making the process more straightforward, reducing the likelihood of delays, and minimizing unnecessary administrative inquiries. These improvements can lead to reduced workload for staff, faster decision-making, and a better overall experience, aligning with our goal to maximize service efficiency and cost savings.\n\nI strongly recommend the web team prioritize these content and usability enhancements.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability Expert and Web Manager"
