But generally, if you are planning to carry out &#039;building work&#039; as defined in regulation 3 of the building regulations, then it must follow the building regulations.\n\nThis means that the regulations will probably apply if you want to:\n\n  Put up a new building\n  Extend or alter an existing one\n\n\nThis also includes providing services or fittings such as:\n\n  Washing and sanitary facilities,\n  Hot water cylinders,\n  Foul water and rainwater drainage,\n  Replacement windows,\n  And fuel-burning appliances of any type\n\n\nThe works themselves must meet the technical requirements in the building regulations.\nThey must not make other fabric, services and fittings less compliant or dangerous than they were before.\nFor example, the replacement double-glazing must not make compliance worse for means of escape etc.\n\nThey may also apply to changes of use of an existing building. This is because the change of use may result in the building as a whole no longer complying with the requirements. Due to its new use, it will have to be upgraded to meet the requirements specified in the regulations.\n\n  See here for changes or alterations to buildings\n\n\nIn summary, the following types of project amount to &#039;building work&#039;:\n\n  The erection or extension of a building\n  The installation or extension of a service or fitting which is controlled under the regulations\n  An alteration project involving work which will temporarily or permanently affect the ongoing compliance of the building, service or fitting with the requirements relating to structure, fire, or access to and use of buildings\n  The insertion of insulation into a cavity wall\n  The underpinning of the foundations of a building\n  Work affecting the thermal elements, energy status or energy performance of a building\n\n\nBefore commencing work you should refer to Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations for the full meaning of &#039;building work&#039; or, if you are unsure, seek advice.\nRegulation 3 of the Building Regulations\n\n\n\n  Contact your water authority\n\n\nMore information on the approval you need for building work.\n\nPlanning permission\nYou\u2019ll probably need planning permission if you want to:\n\n  Build something new\n  Make a major change, like building an extension\n  Change the use of your building\n\n\n\n  Read more about planning permission\n\n\nRegistered Trades Person\nYou will not need buildings regulation approval if you are a registered tradesperson.

      "letter": "To: CEO  \nFrom: Web Usability and Service Efficiency Lead  \nSubject: Recommendations for Improving Online Home Improvement Permissions Process\n\nDear [CEO Name],\n\nBased on recent customer feedback and website content analysis, I have identified significant opportunities to enhance our online service for residents seeking approval for minor home improvements, such as installing kitchens or handrails.\n\nSummary of Findings:\n- The current guidance is overly technical and detailed, which causes confusion and delays for users needing quick, straightforward approval.\n- Users like David, a typical council tenant, specifically express frustration that the information does not clearly outline simple steps or the process for small modifications.\n- Feedback indicates a need for a clear, step-by-step online process including checklists, document upload instructions, and time estimates.\n\nRecommended Progress and Expected Impact:\n1. Develop a streamlined online application form tailored specifically for minor improvements. This form should include:\n   - A simple, intuitive step-by-step checklist.\n   - Clear instructions on required documents, such as photos, plans, and proof of ownership.\n   - Upload functionality integrated into the form.\n   - Estimated timelines for each approval phase.\n\n2. Incorporate visual aids, such as icons or progress indicators, to guide applicants through each stage and manage expectations about processing times.\n\n3. Implement contextual help features, like tooltips or FAQs related to minor improvements, which can reduce inbound queries and administrative workload.\n\nImpact:\n- Increased user satisfaction due to easier, faster application processes.\n- Reduced administrative overhead by encouraging online self-service and decreasing unnecessary inquiries.\n- Accelerated approval turnaround times, improving service efficiency.\n- Potential cost savings by minimizing manual handling and follow-up communications.\n\nIn conclusion, upgrading our online guidance with a straightforward, user-focused, step-by-step digital submission process will directly address customer needs, enhance their experience, and lead to operational efficiencies. I recommend prioritizing this enhancement as part of our continuous service improvement initiatives.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed implementation plan.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nUsability and Service Efficiency Expert"
