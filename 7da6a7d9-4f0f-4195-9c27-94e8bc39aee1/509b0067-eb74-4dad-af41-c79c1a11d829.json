      "letter": "To the Executive Team,\n\nBased on my review of the recent customer feedback, needs, and issues relating to our online services for flat modifications, I recommend targeted improvements to optimize service efficiency and reduce costs.\n\n**Findings:**\n- The current web page primarily addresses general planning permissions for large-scale building projects or renovations, which does not align with the specific needs of residents like David seeking permissions for minor flat modifications such as installing a kitchen or handrail.\n- Feedback from users indicates confusion, as the content does not clearly specify that it is unsuitable for small-scale internal modifications. Customers are unsure whether they should use this page or contact the housing team directly.\n- There is a risk of delays and miscommunications if residents misunderstand the process, potentially leading to increased administrative workload for staff managing unnecessary or misdirected inquiries.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n1. **Develop a Dedicated Flat Modifications Section:** Create a clearly labeled webpage or subsection specifically for residents requesting minor modifications to their flats. This should include:\n   - Clear guidance on the types of modifications covered.\n   - Simple online forms for permission requests, with the ability to upload photos or plans.\n   - Estimated timelines for decision-making.\n\n2. **Explicitly Articulate Scope and Process:** Include prominent notices on existing planning pages indicating that they are not suitable for minor flat improvements. Provide direct links to the dedicated modifications page.\n\n3. **Simplify Language and Clarify Process:** Use straightforward language to differentiate between general planning permissions and resident-specific modifications. Emphasize that residents should use the dedicated page or contact the housing team for small changes.\n\n4. **Automate and Streamline Communication:** Implement automated updates via email or SMS to keep residents informed about their application status, reducing the likelihood of missed updates and easing workload for staff.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Clear guidance and streamlined online processes will address residents\u2019 concerns about delays and confusion, fostering trust and satisfaction.\n- **Operational Efficiency:** Reducing the volume of inappropriate inquiries directed at planning departments will free up staff resources, allowing them to focus on complex cases.\n- **Cost Savings:** Improved self-service options and automated communication will decrease administrative overhead, translating into cost reductions for the council.\n\nIn summary, by refining our online pathways to better serve residents' specific needs and clarifying our processes, we can deliver faster, clearer service\u2014ultimately converting this into operational savings and improved community trust.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability and Service Improvement Lead"
