      "letter": "To the CEO,  \n\nAs the usability lead reviewing recent customer feedback and website analytics, I would like to provide my insights into our current service delivery, particularly focusing on the online experience for our council tenants, exemplified by David.  \n\n**Customer Persona Analysis:**  \nDavid, a 52-year-old long-term tenant, is comfortable with digital technology and prefers straightforward online interactions. His primary need is to apply for permission to enhance his flat, including installing a new kitchen and a handrail. His concerns revolve around delays, lack of updates, and avoiding mistakes that could jeopardize his tenancy.  \n\n**Current Page and Feedback Summary:**  \nCurrently, when a user searches for how to request flat modifications, they encounter a 404 error page pointing to a non-existent page. Feedback indicates that this page provides no guidance, links, or instructions\u2014only a vague message that the page may have been moved or deleted. Users are confused, frustrated, and unlikely to find the necessary forms or information, which hampers service efficiency and leads to increased administrative overhead.  \n\n**Issues Identified:**  \n- The error page offers no direct link or guidance to relevant forms or application instructions.  \n- The vague call to action (\"You could go straight to our home page?\") does not direct users to specific resources.  \n- Lack of clarity and guidance leads to user frustration, increased support queries, and potential delays in application processing.  \n\n**Recommendations for Improvements:**  \n1. **Implement Clear, Context-Sensitive Error Pages:**  \n   - When a page is missing or moved, display a friendly message explaining that the requested resource is unavailable.  \n   - Provide direct links to relevant sections, such as the main forms for flat improvement requests, or a search function to locate necessary information.  \n   - Example Text: \"The page you\u2019re seeking has been moved or removed. You can find the application forms for flat modifications on our [Applicants\u2019 Resources] page or use the search bar to find what you need.\"  \n\n2. **Ensure Vital Resources Are Easily Accessible:**  \n   - Create dedicated, user-friendly landing pages for common requests like flat modifications, with step-by-step guidance and upload options for photos or plans.  \n   - Integrate this link prominently in all relevant content and error messages, reducing user effort and frustration.  \n\n3. **Streamline the Search Functionality:**  \n   - Enhance search capabilities to direct tenants quickly to the correct forms and guidance, minimizing dead ends and confusion.  \n\n4. **Leverage Automated Updates & Notifications:**  \n   - Implement automated email or SMS alerts to keep tenants informed about application status, reducing anxiety and the risk of missed updates.  \n\n**Impact on Customer Experience and Cost Savings:**  \nBy adopting these improvements, we will make the online process more intuitive, reducing support calls and administrative burdens. Clear guidance will empower tenants like David to independently complete their requests, decreasing processing times, and improving satisfaction. Enhanced communication features will also mitigate concerns about delays, fostering trust and compliance while potentially reducing the need for manual follow-ups, ultimately saving the council money.  \n\nIn summary, these targeted usability enhancements will streamline service delivery, improve tenant satisfaction, and optimize operational efficiency. I recommend prioritizing these updates to reinforce our commitment to accessible, user-centered digital services.  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Web Manager's Name]  \nUsability & Service Optimization Lead"
