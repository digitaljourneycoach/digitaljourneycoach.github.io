You should use it to ensure their properties meet or exceed these requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Tell us if you think your property needs different rules and you think another way is better.  \n    If the plan follows the law and keeps tenants safe, we will try to be flexible.\n  </p>\n  <h2 id=\"section-1\">Section 1: What is a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO)?</h2>\n  <p>As an HMO landlord, it\u2019s essential to understand what qualifies as a House in Multiple Occupation. The Housing Act 2004 (HA2004) provides a detailed definition, but here\u2019s a simplified version to get you started:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Is occupied by three or more people from two or more households.</li>\n    <li>Contains shared facilities, such as a kitchen, bathroom, or toilet.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Self-contained flats that don't follow the 1991 Building Regulations (converted before these rules or without approval) are also HMOs, even if they don't share basic amenities.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Typical Examples of HMOs:</strong>\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Single Room Bedsits: May have exclusive or shared use of washing, WC, and kitchen facilities.</li>\n    <li>Flatlets: Multi-room lettings sharing some washing, WC, and kitchen facilities.</li>\n    <li>Non-Self-Contained Conversions.</li>\n    <li>Buildings Converted into Self-Contained Flats: Where the conversion didn\u2019t comply with Part B of the 1991 Building Regulations (fire protection and escape routes).</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"#\">Quickly check if your property is an HMO.</a><br>\n    <a href=\"#\">Find a more detailed description of what an HMO is.</a>\n  </p>\n  <h3>Temporary accommodation</h3>\n  <p>\n    These properties are for temporary accommodation under Sections 188 and 193 of the Housing Act 1996, with a maximum stay of 6 weeks. They can be used for permanent or temporary residence. Occupants won't have another permanent home, and no more than 5 people can stay in one room.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Exemptions</h3>\n  <p>The following are exempt from the HMO definition:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Building occupied by only two people who do not form a single household.</li>\n    <li>Buildings managed by specified educational establishments, Local Housing Authorities, Registered Social landlords, police, fire, health authority, or regulated by other laws like some care homes.</li>\n    <li>Buildings occupied by religious communities.</li>\n    <li>Buildings mostly lived in by owners, including landlords living with their family and up to 2 other people.</li>\n    <li>Buildings converted into self-contained flats, where the conversion meets 1991 Building Regulations.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>What is a single household?</h3>\n  <p>\n    A single household is made up of family members. This can be through blood, marriage (including same-sex), adoption, or fostering.<br>\n    For example, if four friends live together in a student house, they are seen as four separate households. This makes the house an HMO (House in Multiple Occupation).\n  </p>\n  <p>For more details, refer to The Licensing and Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation and Other Houses (Miscellaneous Provisions) (England) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006 No.373).</p>\n  <h3>Mandatory HMO licensing</h3>\n  <p>A property will need a mandatory HMO licence if it:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>contains 5 or more people in two or more households; and</li>\n    <li>contains shared (or lacks) facility such as a kitchen, bathroom or toilet.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    There are rules for licensed HMOs set out in SI 2006 No373 amended by The Licensing and Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation updated in 2007) which must be complied with.<br>\n    There are also minimum room sizes set out in The Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (Mandatory Conditions of Licences) (England) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018 No.616) which must be followed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A Housing Health and Safety Rating (HHSRS) check (as described in Section 2) will be done within 5 years of giving an HMO Licence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Understanding the definition of a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) under the Housing Act 2004 can be complex.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If you're not sure if your property qualifies, getting professional advice is smart. Knowing your property's status helps you follow the rules and make the most of it.\n  </p>\n  <a href=\"#\">Find out more about HMOs.</a>\n  <h3>Planning permission and building regulation approval</h3>\n  <p>\n    These standards are used along with other laws for HMOs and housing. If you change, alter, or extend a building to meet these standards, you still need Planning Permission and/or Building Regulation approval.\n  </p>\n  <a href=\"#\">Make an enquiry about HMOs.</a>\n  <a href=\"#\">Sign up to our new landlord newsletter to stay informed about legislation and topics associated with HMOs.</a>\n  <h2 id=\"section-2\">Section 2: Housing, Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS)</h2>\n  <p>\n    Inspections check property conditions using the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). They look for serious hazards. Inspectors consider 29 possible hazards and can use laws to protect occupants' health and safety.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    They might ask landlords to make improvements. Local authorities can stop people from using all or part of a property or limit the number of occupants. In emergencies, they can take quick action.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If a property owner disagrees with an assessment, they can talk to the inspector. They can also challenge the decision through the First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber).\n  </p>\n  <a href=\"#\">See the Guidance from the Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government on the HHSRS.</a>\n  <p>There are 29 hazards that can be assessed.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Physiological requirements</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Damp and mould growth</li>\n        <li>Excess cold</li>\n        <li>Excess heat</li>\n        <li>Asbestos and manufactured mineral fibres (MMF)</li>\n        <li>Biocides</li>\n        <li>Carbon monoxide and fuel combustion products</li>\n        <li>Lead</li>\n        <li>Radiation</li>\n        <li>Uncombusted fuel gas</li>\n        <li>Volatile organic compounds</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Psychological requirements</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Crowding and space</li>\n        <li>Entry by intruders</li>\n        <li>Lighting</li>\n        <li>Noise</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Protection against infection</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Domestic hygiene, pests and refuse</li>\n        <li>Food safety</li>\n        <li>Water supply</li>\n        <li>Personal hygiene, sanitation and drainage</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Protection against accidents</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Falls (in baths, on level surfaces, on stairs, between levels)</li>\n        <li>Electrical hazards</li>\n        <li>Position and operability of amenities</li>\n        <li>Fire, flames, hot surfaces</li>\n        <li>Collision and entrapment</li>\n        <li>Explosions</li>\n        <li>Structural collapse and falling elements</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h2 id=\"section-3\">Section 3: General management</h2>\n  <p>The person in control of the house must ensure the following:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The manager is capable of inspecting the accommodation and arranging any necessary works.</li>\n    <li>All services, furnishings, fixtures, and fittings are maintained in good, sound, and clean condition.</li>\n    <li>The structure is kept in good order.</li>\n    <li>All communal interior areas are regularly cleaned and redecorated as needed.</li>\n    <li>All yards, boundary walls, fences, gardens, and outbuildings are maintained in a safe and tidy condition.</li>\n    <li>Satisfactory arrangements for the disposal of refuse and litter are made.</li>\n    <li>At the start of all tenancies, the lettings are clean, in a satisfactory state of repair and decoration, and comply with these standards.</li>\n    <li>All staircases and multiple steps have suitable handrails.</li>\n    <li>All tenants fulfil their tenancy obligations.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    These rules are in the Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation (England) Regulations 2006. They are also in the Licensing and Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation Regulations (England) 2007. These regulations place specific duties on the manager of an HMO. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation (England) Regulations 2006 apply to any HMO in England. This does not include converted blocks of flats covered by section 257 of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Licensing and Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation Regulations (England) 2007 apply to any HMO in England described in section 257 of the Housing Act 2004.\n  </p>\n  <h2 id=\"section-4\">Section 4: Standards applicable to all HMOs</h2>\n  <p>\n    To follow HMO management regulations and reduce the likelihood of Category 1 or 2 hazards (see HHSRS above).<br>\n    To ensure the supplementary regulations below are met, these standards should be followed.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Gas supply</h3>\n  <p>\n    If you provide gas appliances, they must be checked every year by a Gas Safe engineer. Keep copies of the certificate and give one to each tenant.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Electrical installation</h3>\n  <p>\n    All electrical installations must be regularly checked and tested to BS7671 standards by a qualified person (like an engineer from NICEIC or ECA).

These switches should work on every level.<br>\n    Light switches should be placed so residents and visitors can move safely through the building.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Electrical appliances</h3>\n  <p>\n    If you provide portable electrical appliances over one year old (like fridges, freezers, microwaves, kettles). These should be checked every year by a qualified person (like an engineer from NICEIC or ECA). This check is called PAT testing.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Furniture</h3>\n  <p>\n    If you provide furniture like beds, sofas, or curtains, it must follow the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Natural lighting</h3>\n  <p>\n    Every habitable room should have a clear window or door that opens to the outside, if possible.

      "letter": "To: CEO  \nFrom: Web Usability & Service Efficiency Lead  \nSubject: Recommendations for Improving Flat Modification Request Process Based on Customer Feedback  \n\nDear [CEO Name],  \n\nAfter reviewing the recent user feedback and the current webpage content, I recommend targeted improvements to enhance our service delivery, reduce unnecessary inquiry volume, and improve tenant experience.  \n\n**Summary of Findings:**  \nThe primary issue identified is that the existing webpage content is focused on standards for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), which does not address tenants' needs when requesting permission for small flat improvements such as installing a new kitchen or adding a handrail. Feedback indicates that users, like David, are confused by the content and do not find clear guidance or direct links to the appropriate process for flat modification requests.  \n\n**Specific Recommendations:**  \n1. Clarify the purpose of the page with an upfront statement.  \n   - **Proposed Change:** Add a prominent header or introductory paragraph explicitly stating, \"This page provides standards for HMOs. To request permission for flat modifications or improvements, please visit [link to the dedicated form or page].\"  \n   - **Impact:** Reduces confusion immediately, guiding tenants to the correct process and decreasing irrelevant inquiries or calls, thereby saving staff time and resources.  \n\n2. Create a dedicated section or hyperlink for flat improvement requests.  \n   - **Proposed Change:** Incorporate a clear, visible link labeled \u201cRequest permission for flat improvements\u201d that directs users to a tailored online form or contact page.  \n   - **Impact:** Streamlines the user journey, making it easier for tenants to access the correct service promptly. This increases customer satisfaction and eliminates frustration caused by ambiguous content.  \n\n3. Improve call-to-action (CTA) clarity.  \n   - **Proposed Change:** Instead of a vague \"Make an enquiry about HMOs,\" use a specific CTA like \u201cApply to make flat improvements\u201d or \u201cRequest permission for renovation or installation.\u201d  \n   - **Impact:** Guides tenants directly to appropriate services, reducing the number of misdirected inquiries, which in turn optimizes staff workload and operational costs.  \n\n4. Consider adding context-sensitive prompts or FAQs for flat improvement requests.  \n   - **Proposed Change:** Include brief FAQs addressing common queries (e.g., process, decision timelines, documentation) linked to the form.  \n   - **Impact:** Empowers tenants with upfront information, reducing back-and-forth communications and accelerating approval processes.  \n\n**Overall Benefits:**  \nImplementing these modifications will lead to a more intuitive, efficient user experience for tenants seeking to make small changes. It will significantly reduce unnecessary administrative handling of irrelevant inquiries, leading to cost savings and improved tenant service levels. Additionally, clear guidance enhances our reputation as an accessible, user-focused council, which can foster greater trust and engagement from residents.  \n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to proceed with drafting the content updates or explore further improvements.  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nUsability & Web Service Improvement Lead"
