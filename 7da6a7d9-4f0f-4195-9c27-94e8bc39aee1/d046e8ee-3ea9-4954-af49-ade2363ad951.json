      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nSubject: Usability Recommendations to Enhance Customer Experience and Operational Efficiency\n\nBased on the recent customer feedback and analysis of the current online process for flat improvement requests, I recommend targeted improvements to streamline application procedures, improve clarity, and reduce delays. These enhancements can significantly elevate user satisfaction while also decreasing administrative overhead, saving the council money.\n\n**Customer Persona & Needs:**\nThe profile of David, a 52-year-old council tenant well-versed with smartphones and digital tasks, highlights the importance of a simple, intuitive digital interface. His primary need is to request permission for flat modifications, coupled with clear guidance, progress tracking, and timely updates\u2014particularly to address concerns about delays and missing communications.\n\n**Existing Feedback & Issues:**\nCustomers report that current content does not clearly guide them on how to apply or track their applications. Feedback indicates confusion caused by vague language and the absence of explicit steps, links to forms, and expected timelines.\n\n**Proposed Improvements:**\nThe feedback clearly points to a need for structured, step-by-step guidance:\n\n1. **Implement a Direct, Online Application Form:**\n   Replace vague prompts with a clear link to a straightforward web form where users can upload plans and photos. This reduces the cognitive load and simplifies the process.\n\n2. **Provide Clear Process Steps:**\n   Include a concise description of the application process\u2014e.g., \"Complete the online form, upload your documents, and track your application status.\"\n\n3. **Enhance Communication Timeline Transparency:**\n   Clearly state expected decision-making times and offer notifications or online updates for progress tracking, alleviating user anxiety about delays.\n\n4. **Use Consistent, User-Friendly Language:**\n   Avoid vague statements. Instead, use active, reassuring language such as \"We will review your request within X days and keep you informed via email or our online portal.\"\n\n**Impact of These Improvements:**\n- **Customer Satisfaction & Trust:** Clear guidance reduces frustration, builds confidence, and fosters a positive perception of council services.\n- **Operational Efficiency:** Digital forms and automated update notifications streamline case management, reduce manual follow-ups, and minimize administrative costs.\n- **Cost Savings & Service Scalability:** Automating and clarifying the process decreases time spent on individual inquiries, allowing staff to focus on more complex tasks, ultimately saving taxpayer money.\n\n**Summary:**\nBy investing in a user-centric redesign emphasizing clear, step-by-step online procedures and real-time updates, we can enhance the user experience for tenants like David while optimizing our service delivery. This approach aligns with best practices in digital service usability, ensuring our platform is accessible, efficient, and cost-effective.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability & Service Improvement Specialist"
