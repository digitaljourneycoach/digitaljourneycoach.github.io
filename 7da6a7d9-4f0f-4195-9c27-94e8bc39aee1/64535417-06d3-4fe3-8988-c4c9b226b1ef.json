      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nAs the web usability specialist overseeing our online services, I have reviewed the recent customer feedback and related data concerning the council tenant experience, specifically around the process for requesting permission for flat improvements.\n\nCustomer Persona & Needs:\nThe profile of David, a 52-year-old council tenant in South London, illustrates a user comfortable with smartphones who values clarity and simplicity in online forms and instructions. His main concern is understanding whether he needs permission to undertake minor improvements like installing a handrail or replacing kitchen units, and he worries about delays or missed updates.\n\nFeedback Summary:\nThe feedback indicates that the current webpage does not directly answer tenants\u2019 questions about permission processes specific to council tenants. It is perceived as vague, especially around which improvements require permission and the steps to request approval. Customers like David need clear, detailed guidance tailored specifically to their circumstances.\n\nIssues Identified:\n- The heading \u201cFind out if you need planning permission\u201d is ambiguous and does not specify it pertains to tenants\u2019 improvements.\n- The information about permitted development rights lacks specifics relevant to typical tenant improvements such as handrails or kitchen updates.\n- There is no step-by-step guidance or simplified process explanation for tenants to confidently understand what they need to do.\n\nRecommended Improvements:\n1. **Revise Headings and Content for Clarity:**\n   Change headings to directly address tenants\u2019 common questions, e.g., \u201cDo I Need Permission for Flat Improvements?\u201d This makes it immediately clear the information is relevant to their situation.\n\n2. **Add Specific Guidance on Typical Tenant Improvements:**\n   Include plain-language explanations about common modifications like installing handrails, kitchen replacements, or minor extensions. Clearly state whether permission is needed, under what conditions, and provide examples.\n\n3. **Implement Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n   Create a simple, numbered process guide specifically for tenants to request permission:\n   - *Determine if the work qualifies as minor or needs permission.*\n   - *Fill out the online permission request form.*\n   - *Upload relevant photos or plans.*\n   - *Receive updates and decisions via email or SMS.*\n   \n   Highlight expected timelines and how tenants will be notified of decisions, addressing David\u2019s concern about delays and updates.\n\n4. **Introduce Visual Aids and FAQs:**\n   Use visual flowcharts or FAQs tailored to council tenants to simplify complex information and reinforce clarity.\n\n**Impact of These Changes:**\nImplementing these targeted improvements will:\n- Significantly enhance the clarity and usability of the permission process page.\n- Reduce customer confusion and frustration, leading to smoother application experiences.\n- Likely decrease administrative follow-up due to clearer initial submissions.\n- Achieve efficiency savings for the council by reducing time spent on clarifying misunderstandings, ultimately saving money and improving tenant satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, these targeted refinements will make our online service more user-centric, helping tenants like David navigate their improvement requests easily and confidently\u2014and in doing so, will streamline operations and cut costs.\n\nRespectfully,\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability & Service Improvement Lead"
