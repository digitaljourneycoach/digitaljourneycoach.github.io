Details of the decision and consultation exercise can be found in the decision document. The Selective Licensing Scheme will become operative from the 13 January 2025 and ends on the 12 January 2030.&nbsp;Landlords and agents can begin making applications via the online application form on this page from the 5 November 2024.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If you wish to see if a property is subject to selective licensing, please use the online checker.\n      <a href=\"#\">Check a property</a>\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>Important information about applying for a licence</h2>\n    <p>\n      The following section has important information for landlords and agents. It sets out the criteria landlords/property licence holders need to meet and the standards for licensed properties. Failure to license properties that need to be licensed is an offence. The council has a range of powers to enforce its property licensing schemes.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>properties must comply with the rent it right standards (PDF) and conditions (PDF)</li>\n      <li>licence holders and agents must be a \u2018fit and proper\u2019 person. Section 66 of the Housing act 2004, sets out the evidence that the council must have regard to and the Guide to completing an online application form directs you to further information on what this means</li>\n      <li>licence holders or agents are required to be accredited within 12 months of the licence being issued</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Licence holders can become accredited with one of the following organisations:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>London Landlord Accreditation Scheme (LLAS)</li>\n      <li>National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA)</li>\n      <li>Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) (can only accredit letting and managing agents )</li>\n      <li>Safeagent (can only accredit letting and managing agents)</li>\n      <li>Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) (can only accredit letting and managing agents )</li>\n      <li>UK Association of Letting Agents (UKALA) (can only accredit letting and managing agents )</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      Landlords who wish to undertake the Landlord Fundamental Course can do so through the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) website.<br>\n      Accreditation is different to just being a member of these organisations and involves demonstrating a level of competence; it usually means you need to successfully complete an accreditation training course prior to becoming accredited.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Landlords should check their membership status with the organisation if they are unsure. To maintain accreditation, landlords must complete Continuing Professional Development. This usually means at least 10 hours of training a year. Landlords who become accredited before applying for a licence are eligible for a \u00a350 discount.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Exemptions from Licensing</h3>\n    <p>\n      Some dwellings and lettings are excluded from licensing requirements, for example:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>where the tenancies or licences are granted by registered social landlords and housing providers, including most housing associations and the Council</li>\n      <li>tenancies or licences granted by police, fire brigade or health service body</li>\n      <li>university/college accommodation occupied by students and controlled by the university/college</li>\n      <li>where the owner or their relatives occupy a property on a long leasehold</li>\n      <li>where a family member rents the property from you (evidence will need to be provided, for example, birth certificates or an affidavit)</li>\n      <li>long lease tenancies, where a landlord grants a lease for a term of over 21 years to a tenant</li>\n      <li>properties leased to a local authority on a private sector lease and used as emergency accommodation</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      For full details of all the exemptions that apply, please see the Guide to completing an online application form.<br>\n      Landlords who are on the cash incentives scheme are not exempt from property licensing and need to apply for a licence prior to the property being occupied.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>How to apply and costs</h2>\n    <p>\n      The Guide to completing an online application form&nbsp;provides further details about what documents you need to provide as part of the licensing process and explains what happens once you've submitted an application.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Licence fees</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Mandatory HMO: \u00a3340&nbsp;plus \u00a3310&nbsp;per letting</li>\n      <li>Selective Licensing: \u00a3340 plus \u00a3460</li>\n      <li>Renewals fee: \u00a3340&nbsp;plus \u00a3200&nbsp;per letting</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      Landlords or agents that are accredited at the time of applying for a licence will be eligible for a \u00a350 discount.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Public Register</h3>\n    <p>\n      The Council has a duty under section 232 of the Housing Act 2004 to maintain a public register of all Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licences and Selective licences, together with any temporary exemption notices served and details of any interim or final management orders made.<br>\n      The resister will include the name and address of the licence holders and any management agents who appear on the licence. The council will use the name and address on the application form for the register, if landlords or agents want to provide an alternative address, then they should contact the council.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Apply for a property licence</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"#\">Apply for a Selective Licence</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#\">Apply for an HMO Licence</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#\">Apply to renew an HMO Licence</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#\">Log in to view saved applications</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      If you need any help with completing the application form or have any further questions or queries, please either complete a form and a member of our property licensing team will respond directly to you or call the team direct on 020 3045 3456: <a href=\"#\">Rent it Right enquiries</a>\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>Licence variations and renewals</h2>\n    <h3>Variations</h3>\n    <p>\n      Following the granting of the licence, the Council can vary the licence either by agreement with the licence holder or if it considers that there has been a change in circumstances since the licence was granted. The Council must notify all relevant persons and consider any representations it receives. Following the variation of the licence, the decision can be appealed by a relevant person. Details of how to appeal the variation to the residential property tribunal will be provided.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Renewals</h3>\n    <p>\n      The council will write to licence holders shortly before their HMO licence expires to remind them they need to apply for a licence renewal. Landlords can apply to renew their licences by clicking on the links above.<br>\n      If licence holders fail to apply for their HMO licence before it expires, then the council will treat it as a new licence application, and landlords will not be eligible for the HMO licence renewal discount.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>What happens if you fail to apply for a Property Licence</h2>\n    <p>\n      Failure to license a property is a criminal offence and the Council may take prosecution proceedings or impose a financial penalty of up to \u00a330,000. On conviction, the Court may impose an unlimited fine.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If convicted of operating a property without a licence (or the council is satisfied that the offence has been committed even though the landlord has not been prosecuted), the council can reclaim any benefits paid when you were operating without a licence by applying for a Rent Repayment Order. Similarly, tenants (including former tenants) are also allowed to make an application for a Rent Repayment Order where landlords have been convicted of the offence or where a Rent Repayment Order has already been granted to the council on the same property.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Failure to licence a property will also have implications on evicting tenants from the property because under section 75 of the Housing Act 2004, no section 21 notice served under the Housing Act 1988 may be given in relation to a shorthold tenancy for an unlicensed HMO.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>Property licensing information for tenants</h2>\n    <p>\n      If you live in a privately rented property that isn\u2019t being kept in a safe condition and your landlord is not carrying out repairs the Rent it Right team can assist with this. We will inspect your property to assess potential risks to health and safety and where necessary require landlords to make any repairs/improvements.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Examples of problems the team deals with include: fire safety, damp and mould, electrical safety and defective gas boilers.<br>\n      Your landlord needs to make sure licensed properties comply with the rent it right standards (PDF) and conditions (PDF).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If you think that your property needs a licence or it isn\u2019t in good repair and fails to meet the necessary standards and conditions please get in contact with us so we can investigate this.<br>\n      The GLA has a rogue landlord checker that you can access.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>Enforcement of schemes</h2>\n    <p>\n      The council has a range of powers to enforce the two schemes, these are set out in the Housing Standards Enforcement Policy (PDF).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Council is identifying and visiting unlicensed properties; landlords who fail to licence their properties run the risk of being prosecuted or having a civil penalty notice (CPN) of up to \u00a330,000 imposed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The GLA has launched the rogue landlord and agent checker database to name and shame unscrupulous private landlords and letting agents who have been prosecuted or fined for housing offences such as allowing homes to fall into a bad or dangerous condition. Any prosecutions or CPNs made by Bexley Council will be added to the GLA rogue landlord checker.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>Public register of licensed properties</h2>\n    <p>\n      The Council has a duty under section 232 of the Housing Act 2004 to maintain a public register of all Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licences and Selective licences, together with any temporary exemption notices served and details of any interim or final management orders made.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#\">Public Register of Licenced HMOs (CSV)</a> for details on whether the property you are interested in has an HMO Licence.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#\">Public Register of Selective Licences (CSV)</a> for details on whether the property you are interested in has a selective licence.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#\">Public Register of TENs Issued (CSV)</a> for details on whether the property you are interested in has a temporary exemption notice.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      The content is updated regularly, but if you would like more information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Rent it Right team at <a href=\"mailto:rentitright@bexley.gov.uk\">rentitright@bexley.gov.uk</a> or 020 8303 7777.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n</main>\n"

      "letter": "To: CEO  \nFrom: Web Manager  \nSubject: Recommendations for Improving Flat Improvement Permission Process Based on Customer Feedback and Content Analysis\n\nDear [CEO\u2019s Name],\n\nAfter reviewing the recent customer feedback, page content, and identified issues, I recommend targeted improvements to our online services to better serve tenants like David and enhance our operational efficiency.\n\nCustomer Feedback Summary:\n- While the user found the content somewhat relevant, it primarily focused on property licensing and enforcement rather than on requesting permission for flat modifications such as installing a new kitchen or handrail.\n- There was clear confusion about the page\u2019s purpose, leading to frustration and potential delays.\n\nKey Issues Identified:\n- The current page content predominantly covers licensing schemes, with no straightforward guidance or dedicated pathway for tenants to request permission for small-scale improvements.\n- Vital links and instructions for flat modification requests are missing or buried within unrelated licensing information.\n- Contact details are oriented towards property licensing enforcement, not flat alteration permissions.\n\nPotential Impact of Improvements:\n- Providing a clear, dedicated online pathway for flat modification requests will directly address tenant needs.\n- Including specific links or sections such as \u201cApply for permission to make flat modifications\u201d will reduce user confusion, decrease support queries, and minimize administrative workload.\n- Streamlining this process will cut down on communication delays, ensuring timely approvals, thus improving customer satisfaction.\n- Enhancing clarity and ease of use aligns with our goal of delivering accessible, efficient services, which can lead to cost savings by reducing manual handling and support case volumes.\n\nRecommended Actions:\n1. Develop a dedicated section on the webpage titled \u201cRequest Permission for Flat Improvements\u201d with a simple online form allowing tenants to specify modifications (e.g., installing a kitchen or handrail).\n2. Clearly link this section from the main relevant pages, including property information and tenant support pages.\n3. Add brief explanatory text emphasizing that this process is separate from licensing applications and clarifying what documents or information tenants need to submit.\n4. Redirect help contact details to include a specific support line or email for flat improvement requests, distinct from licensing enforcement contacts.\n5. Ensure the page is user-centered, with step-by-step guidance, to empower tenants and reduce avoidable queries.\n\nImplementing these enhancements will streamline the application process, improve tenant experience, and contribute to service cost savings by reducing support interactions and administrative overhead.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to draft specific content updates or coordinate with the digital team to prioritize these changes.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Web Manager\u2019s Name]  \nUsability & Service Improvement Lead"
