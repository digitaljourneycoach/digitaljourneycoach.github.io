It&#039;s important for us to ensure that these homes, whether privately owned or rented, are in good condition and well-managed.\n    We use our legal powers to address any housing that may pose a danger to the occupants and making sure that it meets the required safety standards. To achieve this, we enforce regulations and take action against landlords who fail to follow the rules. To learn more about these standards for your housing situation, please contact our team using the details in the &#039;Contact Us&#039; section of this page.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    <strong>How we take enforcement action</strong><br>\n    The type of enforcement we decide to take is always considered on a case-by-case basis and will vary according to the law. In some cases, the law tells us that we must take enforcement action. This includes serving legal notices and orders or charging a penalty fine. In other cases, officers are able to help landlords and residents by providing information and advice.\n    If we have previously provided guidance to a landlord regarding the safety standards of their property and they fail to comply, we escalate the case and take more rigorous enforcement measures to safeguard those at risk. In the most serious cases possible action can include taking the landlord to court.\n</p>\n\n<p>In all cases we will use enforcement to make sure:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>everyone follows the law</li>\n    <li>landlords take action to deal with serious risks</li>\n    <li>landlords who do not follow the rules are held to account</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Penalty charges</h2>\n<p>\n    In some cases, we have the power to enforce penalty charges on a landlord who has not followed the rules as an alternative to taking the landlord to court.<br>\n    We can issue a penalty of up to \u00a330,000 for the following offences:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>failing to meet the terms of an improvement notice</li>\n    <li>failing to licence a house in multiple occupation (HMO)</li>\n    <li>failing to meet the terms of a HMO licence or HMO regulations</li>\n    <li>failing to meet the terms of an overcrowding notice</li>\n    <li>failing to meet the terms of a banning order</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    We are also able to issue a maximum fine of \u00a35,000 for failing to meet the terms of smoke and carbon monoxide regulations. \n    <a href=\"/housing/smoke-and-carbon-monoxide-detectors\">Link to carbon monoxide page</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The actual amount we will charge in each case will be adjusted depending on certain circumstances such as:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>the seriousness of the risk or actual harm to tenants</li>\n    <li>the previous history of the landlord</li>\n    <li>whether the landlord should have known or deliberately broke the law</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Rogue landlord database</h2>\n<p>\n    In April 2018 the government launched a national database of landlords who have been:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>banned from renting out homes, or</li>\n    <li>who have been convicted of certain offences that would harm their ability to be a landlord</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    We will input the details of any landlord convicted or who received a penalty for a housing-related offence onto these databases.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Contact Us</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:housingstandards@wakefield.gov.uk\">housingstandards@wakefield.gov.uk</a></li>\n    <li>Phone: 01924 306665</li>\n    <li>\n        Address:<br>\n        Strategic Housing<br>\n        Wakefield Council<br>\n        Wakefield One<br>\n        PO Box 700<br>\n        Burton Street<br>\n        Wakefield<br>\n        WF1 2EB\n    </li>\n</ul>\n"

      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nSubject: Recommendations for Improving Council Housing Service Interactions and Reducing Costs\n\nAfter reviewing the recent customer feedback and content analysis, I propose targeted enhancements to our housing service webpages to improve user experience, increase efficiency, and potentially reduce operational costs.\n\nCurrent Feedback Summary:\n- The existing webpage content effectively communicates enforcement policies but lacks clear, actionable guidance for tenants intending to request permission for flat modifications (e.g., installing a kitchen or handrail).\n- A notable concern from tenants like David is uncertainty about how to initiate permission requests and a lack of direct links or step-by-step instructions.\n- Feedback suggests that providing explicit, user-friendly instructions and prominent online forms would significantly benefit residents and streamline our processes.\n\nRecommended Improvements:\n1. **Add Clear, Step-by-Step Guidance**:\n   - Develop and prominently display a simple guide outlining the process for tenants to request permission for flat modifications.\n   - Include specific steps, estimated timelines, and checklists to set clear expectations.\n\n2. **Incorporate Direct Links to Online Forms**:\n   - Create or refine existing digital forms for permission requests, ensuring they are easily accessible from the relevant webpage sections.\n   - Position these links prominently, e.g., via a dedicated button or highlighted call-to-action, on the housing enforcement or tenant guidance pages.\n\n3. **Enhance Content Focus**:\n   - Separate enforcement information from procedural guidance for tenants, creating dedicated sections that target different user needs.\n   - Use plain language and visuals to improve understanding and accessibility, especially on mobile devices used by our target demographic.\n\n4. **Implement Automated Updates and Notifications**:\n   - Integrate systems that send automatic status updates or reminders to tenants when their request is received, under review, or finalized, directly addressing their concerns about delays and missed communications.\n   - This can reduce administrative workload and prevent unnecessary follow-up calls or emails.\n\nExpected Impact:\n- **Improved Customer Experience**: Clear guidance and direct access to forms will empower tenants like David to initiate requests confidently, reducing frustration and enhancing satisfaction.\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Automating and clarifying processes can decrease inbound inquiries and administrative overhead, leading to cost savings.\n- **Risk Reduction**: Providing comprehensive, understandable instructions minimizes the likelihood of tenants submitting incomplete or incorrect applications, reducing process delays and potential compliance issues.\n\nIn summary, by focusing on user-centric content improvements\u2014specifically clear instructions, direct links, and proactive communication\u2014we can optimize the service delivery for our residents, enhance compliance, and realize cost efficiencies.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed implementation plan or further analysis.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability and Service Optimization Lead"
