      "letter": "Recommendation to the CEO from the Web Manager \u2013 Usability Improvement Insights\n\nDear CEO,\n\nAfter a detailed review of the current online content regarding tenant improvements and permission processes, I am pleased to report that the existing material offers clear information that addresses the primary needs of our customers like David. The positive feedback received indicates that the page effectively explains the permission process, reflecting a user-centered approach. Great work to the web team for delivering accessible content.\n\nHowever, there are substantial opportunities for enhancement that could significantly improve the customer experience further, increase operational efficiency, and potentially reduce legal and administrative costs.\n\nSpecifically, users have expressed a desire for:\n\n- Simplified, step-by-step online guidance.\n- Clear instructions for uploading necessary documentation such as photos or plans.\n- Estimated timeframes for decision-making processes.\n\nTo address these, I recommend focusing on the following improvements:\n\n1. **Add a Step-by-Step Guide with Clear Call-to-Actions:**  \n   Transform the existing lengthy legal language into a user-friendly, numbered process. For example:  \n   - Step 1: Review the types of improvements that need permission.  \n   - Step 2: Gather required documents (photos, plans).  \n   - Step 3: Complete the online permission form.  \n   - Step 4: Receive acknowledgment and next steps.  \n   - Step 5: Await decision (with estimated timeframe).  \n\n   **Impact:** This will empower tenants to navigate the process independently, reducing the need for direct support, saving staff time and lowering administrative costs.\n\n2. **Integrate Upload Functionality with Clear Instructions:**  \n   Provide explicit guidance on how to upload documents and what formats are accepted, including tips to avoid common pitfalls. Including visual cues or sample upload images could further assist users.\n\n   **Impact:** This minimizes errors and follow-up queries, streamlining case handling, and reducing delays.\n\n3. **Display Typical Decision Times and Status Updates:**  \n   Incorporate estimated response times and real-time progress tracking where possible. Notify applicants automatically about updates or necessary actions via email or SMS.\n\n   **Impact:** Addressing David\u2019s concern about delays and updates enhances transparency, builds trust, and reduces the volume of administrative inquiries.\n\n4. **Simplify Complex Legal Language and Break It into Clear Steps:**  \n   As identified in the issues section, complicated legal terms can discourage or confuse users. Implement numbered lists and concise language emphasizing required actions.\n\n   **Impact:** Clear communication fosters compliance, decreases the chance of incomplete or incorrect applications, and reduces the risk of enforcement actions due to misunderstandings.\n\n**Overall Benefits of These Improvements:**  \nImplementing these user-centric enhancements will lead to faster application processing, improve tenant satisfaction, prevent legal misunderstandings, and free up staff resources for more complex cases. This aligns with our strategic objectives to utilize digital services effectively, providing better service while controlling costs.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to prepare a detailed project plan for these enhancements or conduct user testing to refine the approach.\n\nRespectfully,  \n[Your Name]  \nWeb Usability Lead"
