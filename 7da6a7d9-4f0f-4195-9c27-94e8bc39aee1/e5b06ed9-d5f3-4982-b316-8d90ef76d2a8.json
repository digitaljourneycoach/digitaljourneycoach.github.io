      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nAs the web usability lead reviewing the recent customer feedback and site content, I recommend the following targeted improvements to enhance service efficiency, reduce unnecessary contact, and streamline our processes\u2014ultimately saving the council money.\n\n**Positive Feedback and Recognition**  \nThe current information clearly explains what types of flat improvements tenants can request and outlines the approval criteria effectively. Well done to the web team for providing clear insights into permissible alterations!\n\n**Areas for Improvement and Specific Recommendations**  \nWhile the existing content is informative, customers like David expressed confusion around the actual submission process and response times. Addressing these issues can significantly improve user experience and operational efficiency.\n\n1. **Add a Clear, Step-by-Step Submission Guide**  \n- **Current Issue:** The lack of explicit instructions on how to submit online requests may lead to uncertainty or repeated inquiries.  \n- **Proposed Solution:** Develop a dedicated \"How to Apply\" section with numbered steps, visual aids, or a flow diagram that walks users through accessing the online form, uploading documents/photos, and submitting the application.  \n- **Impact:** This reduces confusion, decreases inbound queries, and speeds up processing times\u2014saving staff hours and reducing administrative costs.\n\n2. **Include a Direct Link and Clear Access Instructions for the Application Form**  \n- **Current Issue:** No direct link or clear access points make it slightly cumbersome for users to find the application form.  \n- **Proposed Solution:** Embed a prominent, clickable button labelled \"Apply for Flat Improvements\" on the relevant page, along with simple instructions (e.g., \"Click here to start your online request\").  \n- **Impact:** Facilitates seamless user flow, encourages timely submissions, and prevents users from abandoning their requests due to navigational difficulties.\n\n3. **Communicate Clear Response Timeframes and Process Updates**  \n- **Current Issue:** Vague expectations about delays (e.g., asbestos testing, approvals) can cause user anxiety and follow-up inquiries.  \n- **Proposed Solution:** Provide a standard response time expectation (e.g., \"Most requests are reviewed within 10 working days\") and outline how users will be kept informed (email updates, status tracking).  \n- **Impact:** Improves transparency, enhances trust, and reduces manual follow-up calls, allowing staff to focus on processing requests rather than answering status inquiries.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nImplementing a straightforward, step-by-step online submission flow, enhanced with direct call-to-action links and transparent timelines, will vastly improve the user experience. This will decrease administrative overhead, reduce delays caused by user confusion, and promote quicker, more independent engagement from tenants. Overall, these improvements will drive greater service efficiency and represent a cost-effective way to meet the needs of our council tenants.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]  \nWeb Usability Lead"
