      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nAfter reviewing the customer persona, feedback, issues, and recommended improvements, I have identified key opportunities to enhance our online services, improve user experience, and potentially reduce operational costs. As a usability expert, I recommend the following actions:\n\n1. Clearer, Step-by-Step Guidance:\nThe current content is too vague, leading to confusion about the process and requirements for flat improvement requests. Implementing a straightforward, step-by-step guide within the application page will help users like David understand exactly what to do, increasing successful completions and reducing follow-up queries. This can be achieved by creating a dedicated, easily accessible FAQ or guidance section.\n\n2. Direct Access to Application Forms:\nThe feedback highlights the absence of a direct, prominent link to the application form. Adding a clearly labeled, clickable button such as \"Apply for permission\" directly on the page will eliminate unnecessary navigation, make the process more efficient, and improve completion rates. This will also minimize user frustration and decrease support requests.\n\n3. Detailed Information and Clarifications:\nProviding explicit information on what changes are permissible, along with illustrative examples, and linking to a comprehensive help page will help users like David make informed decisions. Clear guidance on expected response times will also build trust and set appropriate expectations.\n\n**Impact on Service Efficiency and Cost Savings:**\n- Simplifying the online process reduces the time staff spend answering basic inquiries.\n- Increased engagement with a straightforward, user-friendly interface will decrease administrative overhead and paperwork.\n- Empowering tenants with clear, self-service options minimizes delays and enhances satisfaction, potentially reducing the need for in-person visits or lengthy support interactions.\n- Overall, these improvements will streamline case handling and support a more scalable, cost-effective service model for the council.\n\nIn conclusion, by focusing on making the application process more transparent, accessible, and user-centric, we can significantly improve customer satisfaction while optimizing our operational efficiency.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability Manager"
