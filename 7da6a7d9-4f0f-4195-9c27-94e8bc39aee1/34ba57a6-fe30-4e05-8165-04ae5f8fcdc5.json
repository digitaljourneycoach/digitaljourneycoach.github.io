As a council tenant or leaseholder, you can make improvements in and outside your home, but remember, you must get our written permission before you start. \u00a0\nIt is a condition of your tenancy or lease that you must tell us before you change the structure of the property or alter any of the fixtures and fittings. Here are some examples of common improvements which need our permission:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Adding, moving or rewiring electrics</li>\n    <li>Adding to or changing your heating or hot water system</li>\n    <li>Refitting a kitchen, bathroom or shower</li>\n    <li>Fitting a laminate or wood flooring</li>\n    <li>Putting in a driveway, hard-standing or paved parking area</li>\n    <li>Installing outside CCTV cameras/equipment</li>\n    <li>Installing a smart meter</li>\n    <li>Erecting a fence or decking</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>For a full list of what you\u2019ll need our permission for check online or talk to your Local Housing Office. And if you\u2019re planning something major like adding a conservatory or porch you must also obtain planning permission or building regulations.<br>\n  If you don\u2019t get the go-ahead from us first, we may have to remove whatever you have done and you could even be charged for the work to restore your home.<br>\n  Any alterations that you make are your responsibility to maintain and when you move out you will have to restore your home to its original condition ready for the next tenant. Remember to read the moving out standards for more details of what you must do before you move house.</p>\n  <h3>I just want to redecorate</h3>\n  <p>If you\u2019re only planning on minor DIY such as repainting or putting up wallpaper, you don\u2019t need to check with us first. You only need to tell us if you are making changes like those listed above (but if you\u2019re in any doubt please check with us!) For more information and advice on decorating visit our decorating webpage where you can also find out how you can claim a painting pack if you have moved in to a property that needs decorating.</p>\n  <h3>I\u2019ve already made alterations!</h3>\n  <p>If you have already made alterations to your home please let us know so we can check the work is in line with your tenancy agreement and that it has been carried properly and ensure your home is safe.</p>\n</article>\n"
