      "body": "<main>\n  <h1>During a tenancy</h1>\n  <p>When a tenant moves into the property, there are several things you must do, throughout the duration of the tenancy:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Maintain</strong> \u2013\u00a0You must maintain the main structure and exterior of the property.</li>\n    <li><strong>Deal</strong> \u2013\u00a0You must deal with any problems with the water, electricity and gas supply.</li>\n    <li><strong>Maintain</strong> \u2013\u00a0You are responsible for the maintenance of any appliances and furniture you have supplied. All electrical appliances must have an annual Portable Appliance Test (PAT test), completed by a competent registered electrician.</li>\n    <li><strong>Repairs</strong> \u2013\u00a0When things don\u2019t work (for example central heating), you are responsible to arrange for repairs. In the case of central heating, where you are unable to carry out repairs on a central heating system, you may be required to provide temporary heating. View the\u00a0<a href=\"#\">Landlords Guide to Common Hazards</a>\u00a0for more details.</li>\n    <li><strong>Insure</strong> \u2013\u00a0You are responsible for arranging insurance to cover the building, covering the cost of any damage from flood or fire. You must make it clear to the insurance company that the property is going to be let.</li>\n    <li><strong>Smoke Alarms</strong> \u2013\u00a0Ensure you have fitted smoke alarms and that tenants have a fire escape route.</li>\n    <li><strong>Carbon Monoxide Detectors</strong> \u2013\u00a0Ensure you have fitted carbon monoxide detector where the property has a solid fuel heating appliance. It is good practice to provide carbon monoxide detectors in all properties to protect your tenants from harm.</li>\n    <li><strong>Gas Safety Check</strong> \u2013\u00a0You must provide an annual gas safety check carried out by an approved gas engineer and provide a copy to the tenant. Further information on official gas engineers can be found on the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/\">Gas Safe Register</a>\u00a0website.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Use the expandable menu below to find more advice for landlords during a tenancy.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Landlord access during the tenancy</h2>\n  <p>As a landlord you must give the tenant at least 24 hours \u201cprior notice\u201d in writing. The tenant must give the landlord or letting agent access to the property at reasonable times of the day. Access is only permitted for the following purposes:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>to inspect its condition and state of repair;</li>\n    <li>to carry out the Landlord\u2019s repairing obligations and other obligations under this agreement;</li>\n    <li>to carry out any inspections required by law including (but not limited to) gas safety inspections, fire safety inspections and inspections of any smoke or carbon monoxide alarms installed in the property and to carry out any works, repairs, maintenance or installations (including the installation of any smoke or carbon monoxide alarm) required by law.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>In the event of an emergency, the landlord (or person acting on a landlords behalf) can gain immediate access to the property.</p>\n\n  <h2>Tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment</h2>\n  <p>The right to \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 means that the tenant has the right to live in the property, as their home, without interference from the landlord or anybody else. The landlord cannot make unannounced visits and must comply with the terms of this agreement and the law in all dealings with the tenant.</p>\n  <p>Even where the landlord or his agents give notice of visits to the property, if the visits are very frequent and/or are made for little good reason, this may amount to a breach of the tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment and could amount to harassment. In return the tenant is expected to allow reasonable access, including to carry out repairs and maintenance.</p>\n\n  <h2>Tenants responsibility for repairs</h2>\n  <p>The tenant is liable for the reasonable cost of repairs when they are directly attributable to the tenants failure to comply with their obligations. Tenants are responsible for damage or repairs which are clearly the fault or negligence of the tenant, any member of their family or their visitor.</p>\n  <p>This is covered in C4.1 and C4.2 of the\u00a0<a href=\"#\">Model Agreement for a Shorthold Assured Tenancy</a>. This includes broken glass in windows where it is clear the tenants or their family or their visitors have caused the breakage.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Can the tenant redecorate or alter the property?</h2>\n  <p>Clause C4.2 prevents the tenant from making any alternations to the property, or carrying out any re-decoration without the landlords permission. As a landlord you must not unreasonably withhold permission. For example, putting up a shelf is more unreasonable to be refused. In this case the landlord could put in a condition whereas the shelf is removed, the area made good and then redecorated to its original condition may be considered reasonable.</p>\n  <p>On this basis, if the tenant does not reinstate the area to its original condition, the landlord may be able to withhold funds from the deposit in order to do so.</p>\n  <p>The landlord must provide a property which is reasonably decorated. Kitchens and Bathrooms must have floor coverings which are easy to clean and maintain.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Access during periods where the tenant is absent for more than 28 days</h2>\n  <p>If the tenant leaves the property unoccupied for a period of more than 28 consecutive days, as a landlord you may have access during that period, for purposes to keep the property insured and take steps, reasonably necessary to mitigate the risk of damage to the property during that period. From time to time tenants could be away, for example prolonged hospital stays. Before taking a decision that a tenant has absconded, we recommend you seek professional legal advice.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Tenant assignment or subletting</h2>\n  <p>A tenant must not assign (i.e. transfer to another person) the tenancy, either in whole or in part without the consent of the landlord in writing. This includes a tenant renting out a room to a friend. As a landlord you cannot unreasonable withhold permission.</p>\n  <p>Things for a landlord to consider before permitting subletting are:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>If the property is leasehold and the freeholder prohibits subletting</li>\n    <li>If the property\u2019s mortgage or insurance terms prohibit subletting</li>\n    <li>If the tenant refuses to provide references on the proposed sub-tenant</li>\n    <li>If the proposed subletting would cause the property to become overcrowded or would breach a licence condition where the property is licensed</li>\n    <li>If the proposed subletting would cause the property to fall within the definition of a licensable House in Multiple Occupation due to the number of unrelated occupants.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>A request to sublet would include letting the property out on a short-term holiday let basis through sites such as Air BnB, or on a longer fixed term flat share basis through sites such as\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.spareroom.co.uk/\">SpareRoom.co.uk</a>.</p>\n  <p>Before agreeing to sublet the property, the tenant will need to confirm the prospective sub-tenant\u2019s identity, credit history and possibly employment. If the property is to be used as the sub-tenant\u2019s only or main home, the tenant must also check that all people aged 18 and over living in the property have the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents\">right to rent</a>\u00a0property in the UK (unless it is agreed in writing that the superior landlord will take responsibility for this).</p>\n  <p>If consent to sublet is given on the condition that an additional deposit is paid by the tenant, then the landlord must also protect that additional deposit in an authorised tenancy deposit scheme. The landlord must respond to requests to sublet the property within 28 working days and must state reasons if not granting consent.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Claiming housing benefit</h2>\n  <p><a href=\"#\">Housing Benefit</a>\u00a0is a national scheme, which helps tenants on low incomes to pay their rent, and is administered and paid by the councils Housing Benefits team.</p>\n  <h3>How is Housing Benefit claimed?</h3>\n  <p>Tenants apply to their local council completing an application form either in person, over the phone or online. All applications must be supported by full original documentation, which confirms the tenant\u2019s income and identity as well as confirming the rent charged and the tenancy conditions. Tenants should claim Housing Benefit as soon as they move into a property to avoid losing benefit.</p>\n  <p>Housing Benefit is paid in arrears directly to the tenant. In certain circumstances it can be paid to the landlord direct.\u00a0<a href=\"#\">View information on paying information direct to landlords.</a>\u00a0Further guidance is available at the Government\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-rent\">How to Rent guide</a>.</p>\n\n  <h2>Related content</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Landlords Guide to Common Hazards\u00a0(PDF)</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Contact details</h2>\n  <p>Home Improvement Team, Municipal Offices, Town Hall Square, Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, DN31 1HU.</p>\n  <p>Email: [email\u00a0protected]</p>\n  <p>Telephone: 01472 326296</p>\n  <p>Opening times: Monday to Thursday from 9am to 5pm and Friday 9am to 4:30 pm, except bank holidays</p>\n</main>\n"

      "letter": "**To: CEO**  \n**From: Web Manager (Usability Expert)**  \n**Subject: Recommendations for Enhancing Online Tenant Service Experience**\n\nDear CEO,\n\nBased on recent customer feedback and the review of our current online content regarding tenant applications for flat improvements, I have identified actionable opportunities to improve both service efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\n**Customer Persona & Needs Summary:**  \nDavid, a 52-year-old council tenant comfortable with digital tools, needs a straightforward, step-by-step online process to request permission for modifications to his flat (e.g., installing a kitchen or handrail). He prefers clear information, a simple form, and timely updates regarding application status.\n\n**Feedback & Current Content Evaluation:**  \nThe feedback is largely positive, indicating that the information provided directly answered the query. However, the user expressed a desire for a more streamlined experience \u2014 specifically, a direct link or step-by-step guide to submitting the online permission request, along with a quick summary of the key points at the top of the page.\n\n**Issues & Opportunities for Improvement:**  \n- The absence of a prominent, direct link to the online application form may cause slight friction, especially for users like David who want minimal steps.  \n- The lengthy, text-heavy page with detailed regulations and guidance might be overwhelming or confusing for some users, especially those seeking a quick answer.  \n- Currently, there is no quick summary or key points section that can facilitate a rapid understanding of the main process.\n\n**Recommended Progress & Impact:**  \n1. **Add a Clear, Prominent Call-to-Action (CTA):**  \n   - Implement a visible button or link titled \u201cRequest Permission for Flat Improvements\u201d at the top of the page.  \n   - This link should direct users immediately to the online application form, reducing navigation steps and frustration.\n\n2. **Introduce a Summary or Key Points Section:**  \n   - Place a concise, easy-to-scan summary box at the top of the page highlighting the main steps, required documents, and contact info.  \n   - Use plain language and icons where appropriate to enhance clarity.\n\n3. **Streamline the Application Process:**  \n   - Develop a guided, multi-step online form that allows uploading photos/plans, requesting permissions, and receiving real-time updates.  \n   - Incorporate email or SMS notifications to keep tenants informed proactively, addressing their concern about delays and missed updates.\n\n**Positive Outcomes:**  \n- Simplifies the user journey, reducing the time and effort required to submit applications.  \n- Enhances user confidence, especially for smartphone users like David, by providing clear instructions and immediate access to forms.  \n- Reduces incoming inquiries and follow-up requests, saving administrative costs and making better use of staff time.  \n- Encourages more tenants to engage digitally, promoting efficiency and supporting the council\u2019s digital transformation goals.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMaking these targeted adjustments\u2014particularly adding a prominent CTA, succinct summary, and a streamlined online form\u2014will significantly improve the customer experience. This approach not only satisfies our tenants\u2019 needs but also reduces operational costs associated with manual process handling and follow-ups.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like further details or assistance in implementing these recommendations.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nWeb Manager & Usability Specialist"
