People who have reached state pension age can still claim Housing Benefit.<br/>\n  <a href=\"#\">Check if you are eligible for Housing Benefit or Universal Credit.</a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>Types of housing</h2>\n<p><strong>Social housing provided by a council or Housing Association</strong><br/>\nThe city and district councils offer housing through a number of different housing associations. In addition, Oxford city and Cherwell own housing stock of their own. See above for how to apply for social housing.</p>\n<p><strong>Housing associations</strong><br/>\nThese are not for profit organisations set up to provide affordable homes and support local communities. More information about them and the types of tenancy they offer.<br/>\nYour local city or district council has a list of housing associations in your area. You can apply to live in a housing association property through your local council Housing Register (see above).</p>\n<p><strong>Shared ownership</strong><br/>\nThis scheme gives first-time buyers the opportunity to buy a share in a home. The purchaser pays a mortgage on the share they buy and pays rent to a housing association on the remaining share. Because the mortgage is only for a share of the property, the deposit required is much lower than it would be for the whole property. The purchaser is able to increase the share they own over time usually up to 100%.<br/>\n<a href=\"#\">Find out more about shared ownership in Oxfordshire.</a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Private rented accommodation</strong><br/>\nThere is a large private rental market in Oxfordshire. Landlords or letting agents\u00a0usually advertise online. District councils provide information on renting privately in their area and some run their own lettings service for private landlords. Find more information on your\u00a0district council website.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">Cherwell District Council housing register</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">Oxford City Council housing register</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">South Oxfordshire housing register</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">Vale of the White Horse housing register</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#\">West Oxfordshire housing register</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most landlords and agents let properties for an initial period of six or 12 months which can then be extended by agreement of the landlord. The costs to be expected when renting from a private landlord are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>a refundable holding deposit (a maximum of one week\u2019s rent)</li>\n  <li>a tenancy deposit (a maximum of five weeks\u2019 rent)</li>\n  <li>rent in advance (usually one month\u2019s rent).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More information can be found in the government&#39;s\u00a0<a href=\"#\">How to rent checklist</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Affordable housing</h2>\n<p>The cost of housing in Oxfordshire is amongst the highest in the country. Whilst there is a buoyant private rental market, rents are typically well above the amount paid by Housing Benefit or Universal Credit. Council or Housing Associations offer housing at more affordable rents, but there are waiting lists, particularly in Oxford City.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Finding a Home in Oxfordshire (pdf format)</a>\u00a0gives information on affordable housing.</p>\n\n<h2>Making adaptations to your home</h2>\n<p>If you have difficulty managing in your home there may be small changes that can be made to enable you to live more safely.<br/>\nYour needs will be assessed by an occupational therapist who will discuss options with you.\u00a0<br/>\nHelp with minor adaptations such as rails or ramps is available through the county council.

More information on these and other general help in securing affordable accommodation in the county can be found in this guide\u00a0<a href=\"#\">Finding a home in Oxfordshire (pdf format, 1Mb)</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Housing support for care leavers</h2>\n<p>\nIf you are a young person preparing to leave the care of Oxfordshire County Council you can receive help with accommodation. At 17\u00bd years you will be invited to a Housing Options meeting to help you understand your choices once you turn 18 and what you need to do.\nIf you are in foster care you can stay with your foster carer until you are 21 if that is what both you and your foster carer want.\nIf you are in supported housing you can remain there until you are ready to move into independence.

      "letter": "Recommendation to the CEO from the Web Manager: Usability Enhancement Strategy for Housing Services\n\nOverview:\nOur recent customer persona analysis highlights that David, a typical council tenant, values clear, simple, and efficient online processes for requesting modifications to his flat. While customer feedback is positive regarding the availability of information, several issues have been identified that, if addressed, could significantly enhance user experience, streamline service delivery, and reduce operational costs.\n\nKey Issues Identified:\n1. Ambiguous Section Titles: The headline \"Help with housing\" is generic and does not clearly signal specific service options such as flat modifications or permission requests.\n2. Non-specific Introductory Texts: The general focus of the introductory paragraphs may lead users seeking specific services (e.g., flat improvements) to feel overwhelmed or confused.\n3. Lack of Explicit Call to Action: Sections describing services like minor adaptations mention availability but do not guide users explicitly towards starting an application or requesting permission online.\n\nPotential Progress and Impact:\n- **Refining Navigation Labels:** Updating section titles to be more specific, e.g., \"Requesting Flat Modifications\" or \"Applying for Home Adaptations,\" will immediately inform users about the content, reducing confusion and search time.\n- **Contextual Content Optimization:** Tailoring introductory texts to clearly outline step-by-step processes\u2014such as how to apply for permission, upload relevant photos, and expected timelines\u2014will set proper expectations and lessen user anxiety.\n- **Streamlined Online Application Pathways:** Embedding direct links to simplified online forms within relevant sections, along with clear instructions and progress indicators, will facilitate self-service, reduce phone and email inquiries, and minimize administrative overhead.\n\nBenefits:\nImplementing these usability improvements can lead to:\n- Increased customer satisfaction by providing a seamless and transparent experience.\n- Reduced workload on customer service staff through fewer clarification queries.\n- Faster processing times as users are empowered to complete requests independently.\n- Cost savings for the council by automating and simplifying service pathways.\n\nRecommended Action:\nI propose targeted redesigns of our housing support pages with a focus on clarity, specific headings, explicit calls to action, and user-centric content flow. Investing in these enhancements will modernize our service delivery, better meet customer expectations, and generate long-term savings by improving operational efficiency.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability Lead"
