      "body": "<h1>Home of Multiple Occupancy (HMO)</h1>\n<p>Information for landlords on the licensing and criteria for Home of Multiple Occupancy.</p>\n\n<p>Home of Multiple Occupancy (HMO) is a legal term used to describe a house that is shared by three or more unrelated people, who all share facilities like the kitchen and bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>The law gives a detailed list of criteria that a house needs to meet in order to be called a HMO. The following information gives a brief overview of the HMO definition. It also provides information on the types of HMO that must have a licence.</p>\n\n<h2>What an HMO is</h2>\n<p>An HMO is defined as a building, or part of a building (for example a flat):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>where more than one household lives in and shares an amenity, such as a bathroom, toilet or cooking facilities</li>\n  <li>that is a converted building where more than one household lives that doesn't entirely comprise self-contained flats (whether or not there is also a sharing or lack of amenities)</li>\n  <li>that comprises entirely of converted self-contained flats and the standard of conversion does not meet that required by the 1991 Building Regulation and more than one third of the flats are occupied under short tenancies, (known as Section 257 HMOs).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Why larger HMOs are being licensed</h2>\n<p>HMOs are often linked to poorer physical standards than other private rented property. The people who live in HMOs are often vulnerable or disadvantaged. Because HMOs are the only housing option for many people, the government says they should be effectively regulated.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of properties that have to be licensed</h2>\n<p>Under the Act, there are three types of HMO licensing:</p>\n\n<h3>HMO Mandatory licensing</h3>\n<p>This is for properties that:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>have five or more people in more than one household</li>\n  <li>share amenities such as bathrooms, toilets and cooking facilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Additional licensing \u2013 HMOs</h3>\n<p>A discretionary power we can apply to a particular type of HMO to, for example, include an existing registration scheme. We do not currently have any additional licensing schemes.</p>\n\n<h3>Selective licensing of other residential accommodation</h3>\n<p>In some areas, properties not subject to HMO licensing could be covered under a selective licensing scheme. This is where we can declare that certain areas - for example, where there is low demand for housing or issues with anti-social behaviour - might be appropriate for selective licensing. We have not implemented selective licensing.</p>\n\n<h2>Mandatory licensing</h2>\n<p>All properties that have five or more people in two or more households&nbsp;who live in the property as their sole or main residence,&nbsp;will need to be licensed by law, regardless of the number of storeys.</p>\n\n<h3>The Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation legislation</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;The legislation also brings in minimum room (usable space) sizes. We will identify the number of people who can occupy the property in the licence:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>6.51 square metres for an adult single bedroom</li>\n  <li>4.64 square metres for a child under 10</li>\n  <li>10.22 square metres for two people over 10</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No room under 4.64 square metres can be used for sleeping accommodation. Any area under 1.5m in height is excluded.</p>\n\n<p>If you own a property that meets the criteria, you need to apply for a licence. It is a criminal offence to rent out rooms in a mandatory licensable property if you have not applied for a licence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you are granted a licence but breach it, without reasonable excuse, you can be liable for an unlimited fine - breaching the licence includes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>knowingly permitting the HMO to be occupied by more persons or households than is authorised by the licence</li>\n  <li>failing to comply with a condition of the licence, such as a prohibition against occupation as sleeping accommodation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How licensing works</h2>\n<p>Anyone who owns or manages a HMO that may be subject to licensing must apply to us for a licence.</p>\n<p>We must grant a licence, if we are satisfied that:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>the proposed licence holder is a Fit and Proper Person</li>\n  <li>the HMO is suitable for occupation for the number of persons allowed on the licence</li>\n  <li>the proposed licence holder is the correct person to hold the licence</li>\n  <li>the proposed management of the property is satisfactory</li>\n  <li>the financial structures for the management are suitable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Fit and proper persons</h3>\n<p>We will carry out checks to make sure that the person applying for a licence is a 'Fit and Proper' person. The following will be taken into account when making the assessment:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>any previous convictions relating to drugs, fraud, sexual offences or violence</li>\n  <li>whether the proposed licence holder has committed any offences relating to housing or tenant law</li>\n  <li>whether the proposed licence holder has been found guilty of any unlawful discrimination</li>\n  <li>whether the proposed licence holder has broken any pervious HMO code of practice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a person does not meet the conditions set and the landlord is not a Fit and Proper person, we may refuse to grant a licence.</p>\n\n<h2>Interim Management Orders (IMO)</h2>\n<p>If a landlord fails to bring a HMO up to the required standard, or fails to meet the Fit and Proper person criteria, we can take over the management of the property.</p>\n<p>Under the Act, an Interim Management Order allows a local authority to manage the property for up to a year, until suitable management arrangements have been made. The owner keeps their rights as an owner.</p>\n<p>If the IMO expires and no improvement has been made, then we can issue a Final Management Order (FMO). This can last up to five years and be renewed following this period.</p>\n\n<h2>Penalties for operating without a licence</h2>\n<p>It is an offence if the landlord or person in control of the property:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>fails to apply for a licence for a licensable property</li>\n  <li>allows a property to be occupied by more than are permitted under the licence</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A fine of up to \u00a320,000 may be imposed. In addition, contravening any of the licence conditions can result in fines of up to \u00a35,000.</p>\n\n<h2>Rent repayment orders</h2>\n<p>A tenant living in a property that should have been licensed, but was not, can apply to the residential Property Tribunal (RTP) to claim back any rent they have paid during the unlicensed period.</p>\n\n<h2>Temporary exemption from licensing</h2>\n<p>If a landlord or person in control of a property intends to stop operating it as a HMO, or reduce the number of occupants, and can give clear evidence of this, they can apply for a Temporary Exemption Notice. This lasts for a maximum of three months and ensures that a property in the process of being converted from a HMO no longer needs to be licensed. If this situation is not resolved, then a second Temporary Exemption can be granted.</p>\n\n<h2>Applying for a HMO licence</h2>\n<p>If you think you have a property that needs to be licensed, please contact us.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Allerdale area - email: <a href=\"mailto:housing.services@cumberland.gov.uk\">housing.services@cumberland.gov.uk</a></li>\n  <li>Carlisle area - email: <a href=\"mailto:environmentalhealth@cumberland.gov.uk\">environmentalhealth@cumberland.gov.uk</a></li>\n  <li>Copeland area - email: <a href=\"mailto:envhealth@cumberland.gov.uk\">envhealth@cumberland.gov.uk</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Application fee</h2>\n<p>Landlords pay a fee to cover the cost of the licence procedure. The fee is \u00a3680 for up to eight lettings.</p>\n<p>There is a fee of \u00a319 for each additional letting.&nbsp;There is a discount of five per cent for landlords with professional membership of a landlord organisation (for example the NRLA).</p>\n<p>The fee for a variation of an HMO licence is \u00a3150.</p>\n<p>The cost of additional correspondence is \u00a337.</p>\n<p>Once a licence is granted it normally lasts for five years, but it can be for a shorter period.</p>\n\n<h2>Public register</h2>\n<p>We are required by law to hold a public register of licensed HMOs. The full register can be viewed, by appointment, at our offices in Carlisle, Workington and Whitehaven.&nbsp;</p>\n",

By prioritizing simplicity, transparency, and automation, we can significantly enhance the user experience while also achieving operational efficiencies and cost reductions.\n\nI recommend allocating resources to develop this dedicated online improvement request system promptly. Would you like me to prepare a detailed project plan and resource estimate?\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Manager \u2013 Usability Expert"
