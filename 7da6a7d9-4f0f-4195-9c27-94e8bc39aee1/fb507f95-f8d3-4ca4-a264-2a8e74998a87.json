Copies will be provided following payment of a \u00a377 fee which will be invoiced to the requester.&nbsp;Please contact <a href=\"mailto:HMOenquiries@wolverhampton.gov.uk\">HMOenquiries@wolverhampton.gov.uk</a> to request your copy.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Non-Licensable HMO\u2019s</h2>\n<p>\n  A non-Licensable HMO is when the property has 3 or 4 tenants from more than one household and they share facilities such as a kitchen or bathroom. This does not require a HMO Licence. If the HMO contains 5 or more tenants in the property, the property must have a HMO Licence from the Council and you would need to apply immediately.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you are still unsure of whether your HMO requires a Licence or not, please contact us on <a href=\"mailto:HMOenquiries@wolverhampton.gov.uk\">HMOenquiries@wolverhampton.gov.uk</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Landlords of non-Licensable HMO&#39;s are urged to follow counsel given in the Space and Amenity Standards as a code of good practice. This is to reduce the chance of any contraventions being made under Section 234 of the Housing Act 2004. Any HMOs that are not Licensable should follow the Management Regulations and Fire Safety Regulations.\n</p>\n\n<h2>How do I apply or renew?</h2>\n<p>\n  You will need access to a desktop computer, laptop or mobile device &nbsp;and connection to the Internet to complete your application.

This is in accordance with the Local Government Association \u2018Open for business \u2013 LGA Guidance on locally set licence fees\u2019. This sets out the principle that licence fees should be charged in two parts.\n  The license fee is payable in two parts as follows:\n  Please note the licence fees have increased effective from 1st October 2024.\n  Fee 1 - Application processing and determination fee is charged at the time of application. This is for processing the application up to the grant or refusal of the licence application.&nbsp;\n  Fee 2 \u2013 Licence scheme operation and enforcement fee is charged at the point of granting the licence. This is for administering and enforcing the licensing scheme.\n  There are no HMO licence fee discounts available.\n  All HMO applications will need to made using the online portal which can be accessed under \u2018How do I apply?\u2019\n</p>\n<h3>Fees</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Fee 1 \u2013 Application processing and determination fee&nbsp;Covers costs relating to the processing of an application for an HMO up to 6 bedrooms, up to and including the decision to grant or decline. <strong>\u00a3915</strong></li>\n  <li>Add on costs Fee 1 Application processing and determination fee\n    <ul>\n      <li>7 to 10 bedroom <strong>\u00a3321</strong></li>\n      <li>11 to 20 bedroom <strong>\u00a389</strong></li>\n      <li>21 to 30 bedroom <strong>\u00a3147</strong></li>\n      <li>31 to 40 bedroom <strong>\u00a3205</strong></li>\n      <li>41 to 50 bedroom <strong>\u00a3262</strong></li>\n      <li>For each incremental 10 bedrooms ie up to 60, 70, 80, 90 rooms etc. <strong>\u00a358</strong></li>\n      <li>For each disused room in the HMO building not forming part of HMO but within the building. <strong>\u00a36</strong></li>\n      <li>Commercial areas within HMO building? <strong>\u00a326</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Fee 2 - Licence scheme operation and enforcement fee&nbsp;Covers all costs after granting of the licence, including costs during the life of the licence and costs associated with enforcement of the scheme. <strong>\u00a3544</strong></li>\n  <li>Request for information on missing/incomplete application (per each request) <strong>\u00a377</strong></li>\n  <li>Late application after expiry of existing HMO licence <strong>\u00a3153</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How will you process my application?</h2>\n<p>\n  We will acknowledge receipt of your application.\n  We will check to make sure that everything you have sent in is complete and correct. If so, we will arrange an inspection of the HMO with you, to let you know of any works that may be necessary before it can be licensed.\n  Once the HMO has been brought up to standard, we will notify you of our decision regarding issue of the licence in due course (a schedule 5 notice).\n  If you do not supply the correct information, documents or fee, your application may be rejected until the outstanding issues are resolved. Further, if you do not respond to requests to complete your application, you may be charged licence fees for any reminders sent out.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Will tacit consent apply?</h2>\n<p>\n  No, tacit consent will not apply. This is because it is in the public interest that we must process your application before it can be granted.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you have not heard from us within a reasonable period, contact us as at <a href=\"mailto:HMOenquiries@wolverhampton.gov.uk\">HMOenquiries@wolverhampton.gov.uk</a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>Penalties for not having the correct licence</h2>\n<p>\n  If you fail to apply for a licence, you could receive an unlimited fine upon prosecution and be given a criminal record or receive a civil penalty of up to \u00a330,000 per offence and may be banned from running a rental property.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Will my premises be inspected or assessed?</h2>\n<p>Yes.

Other conditions control the way the HMO is managed, maintained and kept safe for the tenants. The HMO must be brought up to current standards before the licence can be issued.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Planning Permission</h2>\n<p>\n  Please note that if you are considering changing the use of a house into a HMO you must first seek planning permission.&nbsp;Further information can be found here - <a href=\"#\">Planning permission for Houses of Multiple Occupation</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Building Regulations</h2>\n<p>\n  Building regulations apply to a wide range of works relating to converting a building into a HMO or carrying out improvements to an existing one.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Examples of these works include fire and sound insulation between units of accommodation, upgrading / renewing electrical wiring and upgrading / renewing certain heating systems.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When arranging works check that your contractor is operating under an approved industry scheme or apply for the correct approval under the Building Regulations.&nbsp;Further information can be found here - <a href=\"#\">Building Control</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Other Requirements</h2>\n<p>\n  The Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation (England) Regulations 2006 apply to HMOs regardless of whether they are required to be licensed. They impose certain duties on managers and occupiers of such buildings. Broadly those duties include a requirement that:\n</p>\n<h3>The manager:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>provides his or her contact details to the occupiers and displays them in the property</li>\n  <li>keeps means of escape free from obstruction and in good repair and maintains firefighting equipment and alarms</li>\n  <li>ensures that the occupiers of the HMO are not injured because of its design and condition</li>\n  <li>ensures there is suitable drainage from the HMO and a suitable water supply which is not unreasonably interrupted</li>\n  <li>provides annual gas safety certificates (if gas is supplied) to the council when requested</li>\n  <li>carries out safety checks on electrical installations every five years</li>\n  <li>ensures the supply of gas (if any) and electricity is not unreasonably interrupted</li>\n  <li>keeps in repair and good condition the property (including any fixtures and fittings within it)</li>\n  <li>maintains any shared garden and keeps in repair any structures belonging to the HMO</li>\n  <li>keeps in repair the occupiers\u2019 living accommodation within the HMO, including fixtures and fittings</li>\n  <li>provides suitable facilities for the disposal of rubbish</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The occupiers:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Do nothing to stop or prevent the manager from carrying out his or her duties</li>\n  <li>take reasonable care not to damage anything for which the manager is responsible</li>\n  <li>dispose of rubbish in accordance with the arrangements made by the manager</li>\n  <li>comply with reasonable instructions relating to fire safety</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The \u201cmanager\u201d in these regulations includes the landlord or a person responsible for the management of the HMO.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Contact us</h2>\n<p>\n  To find out more about houses in multiple occupation licences, contact us at <a href=\"mailto:HMOenquiries@wolverhampton.gov.uk\">HMOenquiries@wolverhampton.gov.uk</a>.\n</p>\n",
