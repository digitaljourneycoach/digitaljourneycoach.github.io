When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"#\">See all district and borough councils</a>\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Disabled Facilities Grant</h2>\n  <p>\n    The Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) is a means tested grant where money can be awarded to help people who want to remain in their own homes but require adaptations to access their property safely.<br>\n    The Disabled Facilities Grant can used on privately owned properties, rented properties or Housing Association properties.\u00a0<br>\n    Examples of the major adaptations we can help with are:\u00a0\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Level access showers\u00a0</li>\n    <li>Stairlifts\u00a0</li>\n    <li>Hoists\u00a0</li>\n    <li>Ramps\u00a0</li>\n    <li>Through floor lifts\u00a0</li>\n    <li>Level threshold doors\u00a0</li>\n    <li>Automatic doors\u00a0</li>\n    <li>Dropped kerbs/hardstanding's\u00a0</li>\n    <li>Door widening\u00a0</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    The DFG covers works between \u00a31,000 and \u00a330,000 for those who qualify.\u00a0When you apply for a DFG, one of our caseworkers will help you complete a financial assessment to determine if you are eligible for a grant.\u00a0<br>\n    If you are living in a Housing Association property, permission for work to be carried out will be required from the Housing Association prior to being placed on our waiting list. We or your\u00a0occupational therapist will obtain this on your behalf.<br>\n    We can also assist with home adaptations for people being discharged from the hospital through the Discharge to Assess (D2A) program, which promotes quicker hospital discharges by completing necessary changes to your home.\n  </p>\n  <h3>How to apply for the Disabled Facilities Grant?</h3>\n  <p>\n    To apply for a DFG, an Occupational Therapist (OT) assessment is needed.<br>\n    To request an assessment:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Contact Adult Care Services on <a href=\"tel:03001234042\">0300 123 4042</a> or for a Child\u2019s case contact <a href=\"tel:01923470680\">01923 470680</a> (Option 3). Or you can email to:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:seeandsolve.west@hertfordshire.gov.uk\">seeandsolve.west@hertfordshire.gov.uk</a> and <a href=\"mailto:seeandsolve.east@hertfordshire.gov.uk\">seeandsolve.east@hertfordshire.gov.uk</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Once the assessment has been completed and a need for a major adaption to your home is found, your occupational therapist will complete a referral to the relevant department depending on the district/property.\n  </p>\n  <h3>What happens once we receive a referral?</h3>\n  <p>\n    Our experienced team of\u00a0caseworkers, technical officers and staff will help you get the right adaptations to your home to meet your needs.<br>\n    We can help you by:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Advising you on\u00a0your eligibility and completing any forms for a DFG application.</li>\n    <li>Applying for grants.</li>\n    <li>Getting quotes from our approved and experienced contractors.</li>\n    <li>Checking tenders, and appointing a contractor.</li>\n    <li>Planning and building control applications.</li>\n    <li>Project managing works from start to finish.</li>\n    <li>Ensuring the work is completed to your satisfaction.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    We will charge a 15% fee for the work we do on your behalf. This will be calculated on the cost of works and will be subject to VAT.\u00a0There is no additional charge to you as the cost is taken directly from the grant. We can provide further details of what this cost is likely to be once we know more about the work you require.\u00a0<br>\n    When we receive your referral,\u00a0we will create a casefile for you, and you'll receive your own unique reference code, along with a preliminary means test to fill in. Please quote the reference code whenever you contact the us, as this will allow us to easily assist with any questions you have. Once your casefile is created you are automatically placed on our waiting list to be allocated to a caseworker who will\u00a0support you with the DFG application and any work on your home that is carried out as a result.\n  </p>\n  <h3>What is the DFG means test?</h3>\n  <p>\n    The means test considers income, savings, benefits, and age. It applies to individuals and couples, so if you live with a partner, we'll assess both incomes to determine your eligibility.<br>\n    There may not be a need for us to complete a financial assessment in all cases, but we will still need to complete the initial paperwork with you.<br>\n    Once the means test is completed there are three potential outcomes:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Eligible</li>\n    <li>Eligible with a contribution from you (the amount will vary depending on the result of the means test). In this instance, you will need to pay your contribution before we assign a technical officer.</li>\n    <li>Exceeds the grant amount (this means that your assessed contribution exceeds the estimated cost of works)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    A means test might not be needed if:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>It's for a child under 18</li>\n    <li>If you're receiving a means-tested benefit like Universal Credit or Housing Benefit. We'll need evidence of these benefits before processing your application, and the DFG paperwork will still be required.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    If you own your own property and receive a DFG over \u00a35,000, a condition of the grant will require a proportional repayment of the grant in some circumstances. In these cases, we will register a local land charge against your property for the repayment. If this is applicable, your caseworker will explain the process to you.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Who does what?</h3>\n  <h4>Your caseworker</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Will complete the means test to determine if you are eligible for a grant</li>\n    <li>Complete the DFG paperwork to allow us to apply for the grant on your behalf.</li>\n    <li>If you require a stairlift or a hoist, the caseworker will obtain quotes and place the order for it to be installed. If any other works are required, they will place you on the waiting list for a technical officer.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Technical officer</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Will visit your home to measure and complete the drawings and designs for the works.</li>\n    <li>Complete a schedule and send it out to tender with our contactor.</li>\n    <li>Complete a tender analysis and award the contract.</li>\n    <li>Arrange a pre-start meeting between you and the contractor.</li>\n    <li>Oversee the works.</li>\n    <li>Complete a sign off.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    If you live in a council property please contact\u00a0your local council\u00a0as each has their own adaptations department.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Contact us</h2>\n  <p>\n    Any questions for us or about the Disabled Facilities Grants?\u00a0<br>\n    Contact our team:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Phone:\u00a0<a href=\"tel:01438843467\">01438 843467</a> Monday to Friday 9am - 4.30pm</li>\n    <li>Email:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:HIA@hertfordshire.gov.uk\">HIA@hertfordshire.gov.uk</a></li>\n    <li>Post:<br> Hertfordshire Home Improvement Agency<br>\n      SFAR:234<br>\n      Hertfordshire County Council<br>\n      Farnham House<br>\n      Six Hills Way<br>\n      Stevenage<br>\n      SG1 2FQ.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>Other\u00a0useful contacts</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Adult Care Services (including Adult OT Service)</li>\n    <li>Hertfordshire NHS Children and young peoples service</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://hertsindependentliving.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Hertfordshire Independent Living Service (hertsindependentliving.org)</a></li>\n    <li>Age UK Hertfordshire</li>\n    <li>HertsHelp</li>\n  </ul>\n</main>\n",

      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nSubject: Recommendations for Enhancing User Experience and Service Efficiency Based on Customer Persona and Feedback\n\nAs the web usability expert overseeing our digital services, I have thoroughly reviewed the recent customer persona, feedback, page content, issues identified, and suggested improvements. Below are my findings and strategic recommendations aimed at improving service efficiency, customer satisfaction, and cost savings for the council.\n\nCustomer Persona Summary:\n- David, a 52-year-old council tenant residing in South London.\n- Comfortable with online technology, prefers straightforward, step-limited digital interactions.\n- Needs to request small modifications (e.g., new kitchen, handrail) via an online form.\n- Concerned about delays and missing updates, seeks clarity on decision timelines and process.\n\nPage Content and Feedback Analysis:\nThe current webpage provides comprehensive information about the Hertfordshire Home Improvement Agency, the process for grants, and contact details. However, customer feedback indicates some key areas for enhancement:\n\nIdentified Issues:\n1. The main headline (\"Who are the Hertfordshire Home Improvement Agency?\") is too generic and does not directly address the specific user need, such as applying for home improvements or grants.\n2. The information about the councils and the process, while informative, lacks clear, actionable guidance tailored to a citizen like David who wants to make specific requests and receive updates.\n3. The section titled \"How to apply for the Disabled Facilities Grant?\" explains the process but does not offer step-by-step instructions for requesting permission or checking application status.\n\nProposed Improvements:\n- Modify headlines to be action-oriented and specific, e.g., \"Applying for Home Improvements or Grants in Hertfordshire.\"\n- Clarify the purpose of information provided, emphasizing how it benefits the user and what steps they can take next.\n- Incorporate explicit call-to-actions with simple, direct steps such as:\n  * \"Begin your application for home improvements here.\"\n  * \"Check the status of your application.\"\n  * \"Upload photos or plans for your improvement request.\"\n- For transferring user concerns like delays and updates, establish mechanisms such as automated email notifications, SMS alerts, or online dashboard updates that eliminate reliance solely on postal communication.\n- Streamline the online form process to minimize steps, guiding users through each phase clearly and providing estimated timelines upfront.\n\nImpact of Implementing These Changes:\n- Enhanced clarity and tailored guidance will significantly improve customer satisfaction by making the process transparent and manageable.\n- Clear, action-focused content reduces inbound queries and follow-up calls, saving administrative time and costs.\n- Automated status updates and notifications improve trust and reduce anxiety, leading to fewer complaints and repeat contacts.\n- Simplification of application procedures aligns with the preferences of tech-savvy users like David, encouraging more digital engagement and reducing reliance on paper-based processes.\n\nIn conclusion, prioritizing specific, user-focused language, explicit call-to-actions, and automated communication pathways will make our services more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective. These enhancements will not only improve customer experience but also optimize staff workload and reduce operational expenses through decreased manual processing and communication costs.\n\nI recommend we implement these targeted content and process improvements urgently to reap these benefits.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Usability & Service Improvement Lead"
