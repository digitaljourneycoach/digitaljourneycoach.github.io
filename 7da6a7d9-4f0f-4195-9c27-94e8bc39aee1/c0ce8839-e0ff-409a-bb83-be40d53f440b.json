      "body": "<h1>Vicarage Street</h1>\n\n<p>Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council, Warwickshire County Council, and their strategic development partners submitted an outline planning application on the 6&nbsp;September 2022, for a new town centre housing scheme along Justice Walk and a state-of-the-art Library and Business Centre to revitalise Nuneaton\u2019s high street.</p>\n\n<h2>Library and Business Centre</h2>\n<p>Delivering a new library and business centre in Nuneaton town centre will act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the town as part of the wider Transforming Nuneaton programme. The building will be sited on the location of the existing Royal Mail Delivery Office and will act as an economic and civic anchor in a prominent position in the town centre, driving footfall through the town and delivering key services to Nuneaton\u2019s residents and businesses.</p>\n\n<h2>Housing on Justice Walk</h2>\n<p>On the brownfield land to the east of the new library and business centre, between Justice Walk and Vicarage Street, Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council and Warwickshire County Council are looking to bring forward plans for around 50 family homes and a pocket park.</p>\n\n<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<p>This section will be regularly updated \u2013 please check back for further information. You can also submit a question to the Library at Nuneaton if you cannot find an answer here!</p>\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>What will happen to the existing library?</dt>\n  <dd>The current library will remain open as usual while the new library is being built. It will only be closed once the new library is ready to open.</dd>\n\n  <dt>When will development start?</dt>\n  <dd>The scheme will start with the demolition of the Old Church Hall in July 2024. Work will begin at the site of the new library and business centre at Church Street later in 2024.</dd>\n\n  <dt>What kind of houses will be built?</dt>\n  <dd>There will be a mix of 1, 2, and 3 bed houses. 25% of the houses will be affordable housing.</dd>\n\n  <dt>What environmental considerations have been made?</dt>\n  <dd>The climate emergency is at the forefront of our plans, and we are keen to ensure the buildings are ready for the future. We have committed to ensuring biodiversity net gain at the site, and have already been working hard to provide for local wildlife who might be disturbed by the development.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Shouldn\u2019t the money be spent on essentials for the Borough?</dt>\n  <dd>We appreciate that it\u2019s hard to prioritise projects in the current economic climate. In building the library and business centre, we\u2019re investing in the Nuneaton community \u2013 we believe that the benefits it will bring, in terms of improved facilities and services and support for growing businesses, will outweigh the costs. In building now, we\u2019re laying the foundations for future prosperity in Nuneaton.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Isn\u2019t the current library listed? Why is it being demolished?</dt>\n  <dd>There was a campaign to list the present library, but neither Historic England nor the Government Department for Culture, Media, and Sport felt that the library merited listing. This was due to the design itself, and to the way the building had changed over time.\n  <br><br>\n  Warwickshire County Council did explore all options when it came to plans for the Vicarage Street site, including keeping the current library, but the condition of the library meant this was not possible. The cost of maintenance and repair was significant, as the library was not designed to last beyond a certain period and is nearing the end of its working life. We\u2019re looking forward to delivering a new library which is fit-for-purpose and provides the high-quality facilities that Nuneaton deserves.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Will you incorporate renewable energy and conservation principles into the housing design?</dt>\n  <dd>Warwickshire County Council is committed to adapting to and mitigating against climate change. The design of the housing has yet to be finalised, but we will seek to incorporate our commitment to sustainable futures wherever possible.</dd>\n\n  <dt>When is the new library actually coming?</dt>\n  <dd>According to current timescales, the new library will be opening early in 2026. As the plans progress, we will continue to provide updates.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Will the design ensure natural light enters the library from above?</dt>\n  <dd>The current design has both a central roof light, and a large bank of double-height windows around two sides of the building to maintain the natural light which is such an appreciated feature of the current library.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Have you considered a garden/outdoor area for reading?</dt>\n  <dd>We have been exploring ways to incorporate green space into the new library. At the moment, we\u2019re still working on designs, so we\u2019re not quite sure what this will look like yet, but we\u2019re hoping for a way to connect library patrons with the outdoors.</dd>\n\n  <dt>The library is a lovely building, in an ideal position and is a part of so many people\u2019s memories of growing up in Nuneaton. Why can\u2019t it be saved?</dt>\n  <dd>Unfortunately, the condition of the existing library meant that it couldn\u2019t be saved. We really appreciate how special it is to the people of Nuneaton, and we hope that the new library will soon become equally treasured. It will only be across the road too, so the location will be close by!</dd>\n\n  <dt>What toilet facilities will be available?</dt>\n  <dd>Alongside standard toilet provision, the new library will also contain a Changing Places toilet. These are larger than usual accessible toilets which offer extra facilities to support those with complex care needs. We want everyone to feel welcome in the library, and to be able to access the services it has on offer.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>If you have any more questions, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:transformingnuneaton@warwickshire.gov.uk\">transformingnuneaton@warwickshire.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Supporting links</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The outline application can be viewed via the&nbsp;\n    <a href=\"https://www.nuneatonandbedworth.gov.uk/info/21004/planning/93/planning_application_search\">NBBC website planning portal</a>\n    &nbsp;by searching application reference 039175.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Working in partnership with:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Warwickshire Property and Development Group</li>\n  <li>Turley</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Progress Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>May 2024:</b>\u00a0Outline planning permission granted</li>\n  <li><b>July 2024:</b> Royal Mail moves to their new facility in Bermuda Road</li>\n  <li><b>August 2024:</b>\u00a0Old St Nicholas Church Hall demolished to clear site for future construction</li>\n  <li><b>October 2024:</b> Work begins to prepare the Church Street properties for demolition</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>2024</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>Summer:</b>\u00a0Demolition of Church Hall</li>\n      <li><b>Autumn &amp; Winter:</b>\u00a0Site preparation</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>2025</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>Spring-Summer:</b> Demolition of 1-3 Church Street</li>\n      <li><b>Autumn:</b> Preparation for construction of the new library and business centre</li>\n      <li><b>Winter:</b> Construction of the new library and business centre</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>2026</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>All year: Construction of the new library and business centre</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>2027</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>Spring:</b> New library and business centre opens.
