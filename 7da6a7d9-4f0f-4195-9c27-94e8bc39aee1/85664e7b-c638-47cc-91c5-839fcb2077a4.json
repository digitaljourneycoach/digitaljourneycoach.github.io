If you are unsure, please contact us for advice.\nSometimes you may need to submit more than one type of application. For example, if you propose to carry out works to a listed building, this may need a submission of listed building consent as well as an application for planning permission.</p>\n\n<h2>Apply online</h2>\n<p>Apply for planning permission online via the <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/\">Planning Portal</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note;</strong>\u00a0not all application types can be submitted online, the forms for these application types can be found <a href=\"#forms\">here</a>. Your application will be sent electronically from the Planning Portal to us, along with any associated documents and fees (please check our validation checklists\u00a0below to ensure you have all of the required submission documents and plans), Documents should be provided in a PDF format.\u00a0\nYou are encouraged to submit your application via the planning portal and doing so will speed up the process of registering your application.\nIf you need to send us a\u00a0large document\u00a0you will need to share this with us via Office 365. Please contact\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:development.control@northtyneside.gov.uk\">development.control@northtyneside.gov.uk</a>\u00a0to let us know you are going to be sharing a large file. We are unable to receive documents via any other document transfer service.\nHelp and advice on submitting applications online via the Planning Portal.</p>\n\n<h2>Apply manually</h2>\n<p>Have you considered submitting online?\u00a0Your application will reach us in a more efficient and timely manner, speeding up the application process.\nWe encourage you to submit your application online, but if you prefer printed forms, visit the <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/\">Planning Portal</a>.\nForms not available via the Planning Portal Paper Form Chooser or for online submission.</p>\n<p>If you choose to submit manually this can be done by post or by email <a href=\"mailto:development.control@northtyneside.gov.uk\">development.control@northtyneside.gov.uk</a>.\nPlease note we are unable to accept compressed\u00a0ZIP files. Advice on sending large documents electronically is set out above. You are encouraged to use the Planning Portal for your submission whenever possible.\nApplication fees\u00a0can be paid\u00a0by phone\u00a0by contacting 0191 643 2310 or by cheque made payable to North Tyneside Council.\nYou must sign one of the Ownership Certificates which are included in the form.\nCertificate A should only be signed if the applicant is the sole owner of the land/property to which the application relates and there are no agricultural tenants. If your application relates to a leasehold flat or other leasehold property, Certificate A does not apply as the applicant is not the sole owner.</p>\n<p>Notice to complete when signing Ownership Certificate B or C for Householder applications.</p>\n\n<h2>What you must submit</h2>\n<p>Planning applications must, from the point at which they are received and registered, contain all the information we need to make a decision.\nThis helps planning officers to deal with your application more efficiently.\u00a0 Where possible all documents should be provided in a PDF format.\nOur validation checklists (below)\u00a0sets out the information you must include with your application.</p>\n<p>Please be aware\u00a0that all applications\u00a0for planning permission will be expected to be accompanied by a <strong>CIL (Community Infrastructure Levy) Liable Planning Application Additional Information Requirement Form</strong>; any application submitted without this form will be deemed as invalid.</p>\n<h3>Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG)</h3>\n<p>BNG is now mandatory for applications for major and minor applications and Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021) requires developers to deliver 10% BNG so that development results in more or better quality natural habitat than before. \u00a0BNG can be delivered on site, off site (through registered offsite biodiversity gains) or through the purchase of statutory biodiversity credits with a clear preference for onsite delivery.\u00a0 Any habitat enhancement delivered must be maintained for at least 30 years after the development is completed. BNG will be secured by a pre-commencement condition requiring the submission of a Biodiversity Gain Plan.</p>\n<p>Applicants are encouraged to consider BNG early in the development process, and factor it into site selection and design, and to discuss the BNG requirements for their proposal with the local planning authority through its pre-application advice service. Please also see validation advice below.\nMore information can be found online: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/biodiversity-net-gain\">Biodiversity net gain - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a></p>\n<p>For all developments requiring biodiversity net gain a standard deemed condition will be included on all planning permissions, requiring the submission of a Biodiversity Gain Plan. A template for this is available via the link below. In more complex cases a Section 106 agreement will be required. Where significant Biodiversity Net Gain is proposed, a Habitat Management and Monitoring Plan will be required. This should include detailed information on how the habitat creation/enhancement will be undertaken, and how the habitats will be managed and monitored for the next 30 years. It should set out a schedule of monitoring visits and the surveys that will be required, as well as a caveat for regular reviews of the management measures and may include a procedure for remedial measures if the habitat is not developing as expected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/submit-a-biodiversity-gain-plan/biodiversity-gain-plan\">Biodiversity gain plan - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/files/BNG%20Guidance%20Developers%20(NTC)%20Feb%2024%20V1.pdf\">BNG Guidance Developers (NTC) Feb 24 V1.pdf</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Application fees</h2>\n<p>Calculate your fees on the <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/\">Planning Portal</a> or download our <a href=\"/files/Scale%20of%20Fees%20effective%20from%201st%20April%202025.pdf\">scale of fees</a>.</p>\n<p>Planning fees will increase from 1st April 2025.\u00a0 If you have submitted an\u00a0application that is currently invalid, if this is still invalid after 5pm on 31st March, then the new fee increase will apply.\u00a0 All fee's are increased by 1.7%, please note the higher increase for applications for the enlargement, improvement or alteration of a dwelling house, some prior approvals and for discharge of conditions.\nThere is also a new 3 tier banding for fee's for section 73 applications.\nThis increase is the annual rise linked to inflation which will apply every April, from 2025 onwards.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/files/Scale%20of%20Fees%20effective%20from%201st%20April%202025.pdf\">Scale of Fees effective from 1st April 2025.pdf</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Is your application valid</h2>\n<p>When we receive your application, it will be formally checked to make sure that it is accurate and complete.
