A portion of funds allocated to Oxfordshire County Council have been allocated to Vale of White Horse and South Oxfordshire district councils as part of a wider support package across the county, which includes help for children eligible for free school meals through the holidays.</p>\n<p>Funding is limited and the scheme is open initially to people who have not had support from it before. However, the councils will open it to second applications if funds remain.</p>\n<p>Cllr Helen Pighills, Cabinet Member for Healthy Communities at Vale of White Horse District Council said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s a change in circumstances or the rise in the cost of living that\u2019s causing pressure \u2013 we urge people in financial difficulty who have not already received assistance from this fund to apply for the help that\u2019s now available.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cllr Maggie Filipova-Rivers, Cabinet Member for Community Wellbeing at South Oxfordshire District Council said: \u201cFinancial issues can affect us at very different times in life. Struggling to afford to pay the bills is a reality for many, and we want residents to access this help for that very reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>The funds are not restricted to people in receipt of benefits and there is no requirement that residents must be employed or must be unemployed. In contrast to previous schemes, a portion of the funds will be allocated specifically to support pensioner households.</p>\n<p>To find out about the scheme and to complete an application form please visit the councils\u2019 webpages:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.whitehorsedc.gov.uk/vale-of-white-horse-district-council/cost-of-living-crisis-advice-and-support/household-support-fund/\">whitehorsedc.gov.uk/household-support-fund</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.southoxon.gov.uk/household-support-fund/\">southoxon.gov.uk/household-support-fund</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The scheme will end in September 2022, unless funds are spent sooner.</p>\n```",
