However, in most cases, the HTML structure would be more complex and contain additional non-essential elements. Here's a simplified approach to extract only the main body content from a typical HTML page:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef clean_html(html):\n    # Initialize BeautifulSoup with HTML parsing settings\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser', from_strings=True)\n\n    # Remove non-content tags and elements\n    for tag in ['head', 'body':1, 'script', 'style']:\n        soup.find(tag).decompose()\n\n    # Preserve semantic structural elements\n    main_structures = {'h1','h2','h3','h4','h5','h6','p','a','button',\n                        'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'blockquote'}\n\n    cleaned_html = soup.find('div', class_='main-wrapper') \\\n                         .find_all(regex=True, string=main_structures)\n\n    # Remove any remaining unnecessary elements after cleaning\n    for elem in cleaned_html:\n        if not str(elem).strip() and isinstance(elem.parent, list):\n            elem.parent.remove(elem)\n\n    return cleaned_html\n```\n\nThis function extracts the main body content based on given criteria by removing any non-essential page furniture, preserving semantic HTML, and returning the clean, structured HTML content as a list of elements. Note that for simplicity, this example uses BeautifulSoup without any additional libraries or dependencies.",
