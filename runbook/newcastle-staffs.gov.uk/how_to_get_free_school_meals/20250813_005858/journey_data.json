The `<body>` section includes several main sections like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<aside>`.\n\n3. The `<header>` section contains a logo, navigation menu, and search bar.\n\n4. The `<main>` section includes sections for the main content, featured content, and supplementary content (secondary). Content within these sections can vary greatly depending on the specific site's purpose and design. In this case, it appears to be a local government website providing information about services and resources for residents.\n\n5. The navigation menu in the header provides links to various pages on the website, including \"Council tax\", \"Benefits\", \"Bins & recycling\", \"Housing\", among others.\n\n6. The Supplements section (aside--below) includes a container for additional content that might appear below the main content.
