Your bin should be presented on your property boundary by 6:00 am on the scheduled collection day. The lid must be closed for efficient emptying.\n\n2. The appropriate bin should be used for specific waste types, such as green for garden waste, blue for recyclable materials, and black for general waste. Extra recycling bags can be purchased from council offices or libraries.\n\n3. Heavy or bulky items like furniture, mattresses, and electrical appliances cannot be placed in your bin. Instead, they should be booked for a bulky waste collection or taken to a local recycling center.\n\n4. Garden waste should only be put out for collection between March 31st and November 7th each year.\n\n5. If you wish to buy additional wheelie bins, please contact the council with your property details for an assessment.\n\n6. Bins should not be placed on pavements or roads during snowfall or icy conditions, as they can obstruct gritting and winter maintenance operations.\n\n7. On bank holiday collection days, collections will be one day later than scheduled across the week, with normal service resuming from the following Monday.\n\n8. If your bin has been missed and none of the above applies to your collection, please report it within two working days. You can do this via phone call, email, or using an online reporting system provided by Hertsmere Borough Council.\n\n9. For more information on the service rules, you can download the Bin Collection Service Rules PDF from their official website.",
