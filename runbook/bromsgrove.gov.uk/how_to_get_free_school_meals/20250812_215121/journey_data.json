The `head` tag contains basic meta information about the page, such as its title, charset, and links to external resources like stylesheets and fonts.\n2. The `body` has the main content of the page. Inside the body element:\n   - There's a container div with classes \"container-fluid,\" which centers the content horizontally on modern browsers, and sets the height and the width.\n      - Inside it is another wrapper div with classes \"padt0 padb25\" that contains a series of three columns (left, center, right) created using Bootstrap's grid system.\n        1. The left column (with class \"col-md-6 column\") includes a Google Translate widget and social sharing buttons.\n        2. The central column (with class \"col-md-5 column padleft10\") contains an area for the Umbraco Forms form. You can fill out this section to create your own custom form with inputs, labels, and validation rules.\n        3. The right column (with class \"col-md-1 column\") is currently empty.\n      - Lastly, it includes footer navigation, a copyright notice, and links to CSS variables for style management.\n   - Outside the wrapper div, there's a script tag that loads jQuery and the Google Translate API, which enables multilingual support on your webpage.",
