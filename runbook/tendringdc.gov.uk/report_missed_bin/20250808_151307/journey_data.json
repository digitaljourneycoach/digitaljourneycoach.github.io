Here is a simplified explanation:\n\n1. The web page offers users several cookies categories: essential (required for basic website functionality), marketing, personalization, and analytics. By default, all categories are set to \"essential.\"\n2. Users have the option to reject or accept cookies by category using checkboxes provided on the page. If they wish to accept no cookies at all, they can select \"Reject all cookies.\"\n3. After making their selections, users confirm their preferences and close the cookie preference center. Upon confirmation, a hidden form is submitted in the background to save their selected options.\n4. The cookie preference center contains a toggle option for users to switch between different languages (if needed) by selecting the British or American flag icons at the bottom of the screen.\n5. It also includes a \"Skip-to-main\" script, which likely automatically scrolls down to the primary content of the webpage if users choose to ignore the cookie notification.\n6. At the bottom of the page, there is a Privacy Policy link and a Contact Us form (not shown in the provided code), providing users with additional resources for learning more about the website's data privacy practices.",
