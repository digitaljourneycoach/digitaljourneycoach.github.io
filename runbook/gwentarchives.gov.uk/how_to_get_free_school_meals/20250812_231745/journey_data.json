His first will was put together in 1715 but was cancelled and a new one was made in 1717. In this will, he left &pound;4,000 to found a charity school for thirty boys and twenty girls in Caerleon-on-Usk, and to pay for their apprenticing &mdash; so far as the balance permitted; the school was built in 1724.</p>\n<p>In 1864, a separate Infants Department was created, meaning that the there were now: Boys', Girls' and Infants' Schools. At the same time the Infants' and Mixed schools on Goldcroft Common closed and pupils were transferred to the Endowed schools.</p>\n<p>During the 19th century the Boys' and Girls' Schools were also known as the \"Blue Schools\" or \"Blue Coat Schools\".</p>\n<p>In 1948, separate Boys and Girls schools ceased to operate. Instead three separate schools came into existence: the Endowed Infants&rsquo; School, the Endowed Junior School and the Endowed Secondary Modern School.</p>\n<p>In 1964, Caerleon County Secondary Modern School opened. Staff and pupils moved from the Endowed Secondary Modern School to the new school building.</p>\n<p>In 2014, an amalgamation took place between the Charles Williams Infants and Junior Schools. The new school is now called &ldquo;Charles Williams Church in Wales Primary School&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ref2\">Scope and Contents note</h3>\n<p>Records include Admission Registers and Log Books inter alia</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adminInfo\">Administrative Information</h3>\n<h4>Publication Information</h4>\n<p>Gwent Archives</p>\n<h4 id=\"ref5\">Conditions Governing Access note</h4>\n<p>Please refer to our policy document on closure periods, available at www.gwentarchives.gov.uk</p>\n<h4 id=\"ref6\">Conditions Governing Use note</h4>\n<p>Usual copyright conditions apply</p>\n<h4 id=\"ref4\">Accruals note</h4>\n<p>Accruals are expected</p>\n<h4 id=\"ref3\">Appraisal note</h4>\n<p>Records have been appraised along the lines of the Gwent Archives' Collections Management and Appraisal Policies</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ref7\">Other Finding Aids note</h3>\n<p>Copies of finding aids are available at Gwent Archives</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"N1006E\">Collection Inventory</h3>\n\n<h4>CEB69/1 Boys' School</h4>\n<h4>CEB69/1/1 Log Books</h4>\n<p>CEB69/1/1/1  30 Aug 1920-10 Jul 1964   1.0 vol.</p>\n\n<h4>Related Archival Materials note</h4>\n<p>See also: CEB69/5/1 for Boys' 1864-1878</p>\n\n<p>CEB69/1/2/2  1884-1910   1.0 vol.</p>\n<p>CEB69/1/2/3  1910-1935   1.0 vol.</p>\n<p>CEB69/1/2/4  1935-1948   1.0 vol.</p>\n<h4>CEB69/1/3 Photographs</h4>\n<p>CEB69/1/3/1 B/W photograph: Boys School Football Team (with names) 1929-1930   1.0 item</p>\n<h4>Custodial History note</h4>\n<p>Photograph donated to School by Norman Stevens of Caerleon, 1994</p>\n\n<h4>CEB69/3 Infants' School</h4>\n<h4>CEB69/3/1 Log Books</h4>\n<p>CEB69/3/1/1 Log Book: 25 Sep 1905-16 July 1931 (enclosures include an HMI Report on the Girls&rsquo; Department 1948) 1905-1948   1.0 vol.</p>\n\n<h4>CEB69/3/2 Summary Registers</h4>\n<p>CEB69/3/3/4  1943-1948   1.0 vol.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ref80\">CEB69/4/2/4 Miscellaneous</h4>\n<p>Album labelled \"Memories of AY5 Approx 1995.\" Album includes colour photographs of activities taking place at school, and a school trip to Llancaich Fawr c.1995   1.0 vol.</p>\n\n<h4>Biographical/Historical note</h4>\n<p>In 1864, the Infants' and Mixed schools on Goldcroft Common closed and pupils were transferred to the Endowed schools.</p>\n```",
