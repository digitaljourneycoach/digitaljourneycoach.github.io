School meals can also save you time and provide peace of mind that your child is enjoying a healthy, fresh, and nutritious meal at lunchtime.</p>\n<h2>Free school meals for all Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 pupils</h2>\n<p>All children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 are entitled to free school meals under the Universal Infant Free School Meal Scheme. You do not need to complete an application form, just get in touch with your school and they can arrange this for you.</p>\n<p>Although this is not means-tested, if you do qualify for any financial support shown below, we would encourage you to complete our online form as this could enable your child's school to claim the Pupil Premium Funding to further support them.</p>\n<h2>Free school meals for all years for pupils whose families receive financial support</h2>\n<p>If you get certain benefits, your child could also qualify for free school meals during all school years. To qualify you must be receiving:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Universal Credit, provided you have an annual net earned income of no more than \u00a37,400, as assessed by earnings from up to three of your most recent assessment periods (\u00a3616.67 per month)</li>\n<li>Income Support</li>\n<li>Income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance</li>\n<li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>\n<li>support under part six of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>\n<li>the guarantee element of Pension Credit</li>\n<li>Child Tax Credit, provided you are also not entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual household gross income that does not exceed \u00a316,190 (as assessed by HMRC)</li>\n<li>Working Tax Credit run-on, paid for four weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that contributions-based benefits, including contribution-related Jobseekers' Allowance do not entitle you to claim free school meals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fisportal.northyorks.gov.uk/Synergy/fsm_prereq.aspx\">Apply for free school meals</a></p>\n<p>You will receive an instant decision on whether your application is successful. If it is, we will fully process the application in five working days and notify the school. Once the school have received this your child can begin enjoying free school meals. You should continue to pay until confirmation comes through. Schools may be able to arrange reimbursement of payment made while your entitlement is being confirmed.</p>\n<p>Free school meals claims cannot be backdated. They are awarded from the date we receive the application, once eligibility is confirmed. This is because there is a legal requirement for a request to be made, before a free school meal can be provided. If you are not entitled to free school meals, you will be notified in writing.</p>\n<p>Once a year we will now be looking to find households who appear to qualify for free school meals but have not made an application. We will contact the families we have identified directly by letter to explain how we can help automatically enrol them onto free schools meals if they wish to receive them.</p>\n<h2>No recourse to public funds (NRPF) and free school meals eligibility</h2>\n<p>The government have extended free school meal eligibility to children in all households with no recourse to public funds, subject to maximum income thresholds.</p>\n\n<h2>No recourse to public funds - eligible groups and income thresholds</h2>\n<p>These groups include, but may not be limited to children of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zambrano carers</li>\n<li>families who have no recourse to public funds with a right to remain in the UK on grounds of private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights</li>\n<li>families receiving support under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 who are also subject to a no recourse to public funds restriction</li>\n<li>a subset of failed asylum seekers supported under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>\n<li>Chen carers</li>\n<li>families holding a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa\">British National overseas passport</a></li>\n<li>spousal visa holders</li>\n<li>work visa holders</li>\n<li>student visa holders</li>\n<li>those with no immigration status</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The maximum income threshold differs based on your location and the number of children that your family has.</p>\n<h2>Income thresholds</h2>\n<p>Under the permanent extension of free school meal eligibility to all no recourse to public funds groups, the annual household income thresholds for those families able to work are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a322,700 for families outside of London with 1 child</li>\n<li>\u00a326,300 for families outside of London with 2 or more children</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>No recourse to public funds application process - confirming your status and income</h2>\n<p>There is a different application form for families applying under this criteria, which includes a self-declaration that can be used for verifying eligibility. This is available from your child\u2019s school.</p>\n<p>Your child\u2019s school can help complete it if necessary.</p>\n<p>Please note: the online application form should not be used for households in this category, as some families will not have a national insurance number. Those that do have a national insurance number, cannot be assessed for eligibility using the online Department of Education free school meals electronic checking system, as this only checks eligibility against an applicant\u2019s benefits, which these families have no recourse to.</p>\n<h2>Confirming no recourse to public funds status</h2>\n<p>Please find below some examples of how you can demonstrate your no recourse to public funds status, this list is not exhaustive.</p>\n<h3>Article 8 of the ECHR</h3>\n<p>Families will be able to provide a letter from the Home Office granting them leave to remain in the UK or a biometric residence card.</p>\n\n<h3>Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</h3>\n<p>Families will be able to provide a letter from the Home Office or local authority confirming Section 4 support or an ASPEN card.</p>\n\n<h3>British National overseas passport holders</h3>\n<p>Families will be able to show either a British National overseas passport or visa.</p>\n\n<h3>Spouse, work or student visa holders</h3>\n<p>Families will be able to show their visa.</p>\n\n<h3>Zambrano or Chen carers</h3>\n<p>In many (but not all) cases, the family will be able to show a derivative residence card. If they do not hold this, they must be able to show that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the carer or parent is not a British citizen</li>\n<li>the child is a British citizen</li>\n<li>the carer is a direct relative or legal guardian of the child, and they have the primary responsibility for the child</li>\n<li>there are no other members of the carers\u2019 family in the UK or the EEA who could look after the child</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Confirming your income</h2>\n<p>Families should complete a self-declaration of their income as part of their application.</p>\n<p>To verify this, they will need to show one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>payslip</li>\n<li>P60</li>\n<li>bank statement</li>\n<li>letter from their bank</li>\n<li>letter from their employer</li>\n<li>letter from the local authority confirming support if applicable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Paid for school meals</h2>\n<p>If you do not qualify for free school meals you can still pay for excellent value school meals that ensure your child gets a nutritious and tasty meal.

Do I need to reapply for their free school meals?</h3>\n<p>If your child is moving from a North Yorkshire primary school to a North Yorkshire secondary school, then you do not need to reapply. The free school meals will automatically transfer to their new school before they start. The only exception to this is when a child is transferring to Rossett School or South Craven School. If your child is transferring to either of these schools, you should contact the school directly to ask if they need you to reapply.</p>\n<p>If your child is moving to a secondary school which is within the boundaries of another local authority, please contact that local authority directly to find out about any reapplication process that might be necessary.</p>\n\n<h3>My child is moving to secondary school and currently receives free school meals at their primary school. How do the free school meals work at the new school?</h3>\n<p>The school is responsible for crediting your child's dinner account every day with the free school meals allowance. Unfortunately, we can't advise you how much this will be because it is different from school to school. However, you should be free to top up the allowance if you wish.</p>\n<p>Please contact the school directly to find out how much the daily allowance will be.</p>\n```",
