You can donate, sell, or give away items that are still in good condition, or repurpose them for other uses. There are many online resources available to help you find ways to reuse common household items.\n\nFor example:\n\n* [Ideas For Reusing Household Items](https://www.wikihow.com/Reuse-Household-Items) (a wikiHow article with ideas for reusing a variety of everyday items)\n* The [Reuse Network](https://reusenetwork.org/) is an organization that aims to promote and facilitate reuse in the UK.
