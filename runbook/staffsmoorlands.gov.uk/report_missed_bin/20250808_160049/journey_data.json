The page includes an option to start a new form if the user wishes to create a new request, or they can upload a file containing multiple requests if they have collected information from several users offline.\n\nThe main structure of the webpage is divided into different sections, including a header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer. The content area contains a form for submitting the missed bin collection report, along with options for the user to either input their request directly or upload a file containing multiple requests. If there are any validation errors in the submitted data, error messages will be displayed, along with options to correct them and resubmit the form.\n\nThe code also includes a modal dialog for uploading files when offline data is available. Inside this dialog, users can select the files they wish to upload, and upon clicking the \"Upload\" button, the JavaScript function `fileUpload()` will be triggered, which sends the selected files to the server using AJAX requests and updates the user interface accordingly. When all the files have been uploaded, the user can click the \"Finished\" button to complete the process and close the dialog.\n\nThe page also displays a copyright message at the bottom, indicating that it was designed and developed by IEG4 using eFormStudio software and powered by Microsoft technologies.",
