The smiles have corresponding title attributes with text descriptions of their rating options.\n\nThe smiley faces are clickable links that point to a survey URL with a different rating option based on the chosen smiley face (e.g., `https://websurveys2.govmetric.com/theme/gm/2257?Q_RATINGID=1`, `https://websurveys2.govmetric.com/theme/gm/2257?Q_RATINGID=4`).\n\nThe HTML code also includes a div with class \"gm-header\" for the website header and a navigation menu with links to various sections of the site.
