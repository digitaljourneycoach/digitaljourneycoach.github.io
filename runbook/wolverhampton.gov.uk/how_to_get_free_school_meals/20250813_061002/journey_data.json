There is more information about this under \u201c<strong>Other help and support +</strong>\u201d below.<br>City of Wolverhampton Council hasn\u2019t issued free school meals vouchers during the school holidays since February half-term 2021, in line with Government recommendation for a return to food-based support at that time.</p>\n<h2>Free School Meals application</h2>\n<p>City of Wolverhampton Council can check your FSM application, if your child is at a school that uses our <a href=\"/node/19562\">FSM Eligibility Checking Service</a>.</p>\n<p>If your child has a protected FSM claim in place, you do not need to apply again.</p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t sure if your child has an FSM claim in place, please ask your child\u2019s school.</p>\n<p>If your child does not already have an FSM claim in place, the easiest way to apply is through your child\u2019s school.</p>\n<p><strong>Updated Government guidance as of 5 June 2025</strong></p>\n<p>Transitional protections have been extended until the end of the 2025/26 school year. All pupils becoming eligible for free school meals under the benefits-based criteria, should continue to receive this entitlement, regardless of any change in household circumstances or phase of education until the end of the 2025/26 school year.</p>\n<p>From the start of the 2026/27 school year, the Department for Education will introduce new eligibility criteria meaning that all children from households in receipt of Universal Credit will be entitled to receive a free meal. It is our intention to end transitional protections alongside this change in threshold, with eligibility for all pupils reverting to whether they meet the eligibility criteria regardless of whether they were previously protected. We will issue further guidance ahead of September 2026.</p>\n<p>This does not apply to families that are eligible for free school meals under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 or the guarantee element of the Pension Credit, nor to those with no recourse to public funds (NRPF).</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about school meals, please contact your child/ren\u2019s school/s. Menus, prices and arrangements vary from school to school.</p>\n<p>There is more information about \u201cOther help and support +\u201d available below.</p>\n<h2>Am I eligible?</h2>\n<p>These are the Government\u2019s eligibility criteria for benefits-related Free School Meals (FSM):</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Income Support</li>\n    <li>Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance</li>\n    <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>\n    <li>Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>\n    <li>The guaranteed element of Pension Credit</li>\n    <li>Child Tax Credit (provided you're not also entitled to Working Tax Credit) and have an annual gross income of no more than \u00a316,190</li>\n    <li>Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</li>\n    <li>Universal Credit - if you apply on or after 1 April 2018, your household income must be less than \u00a37,400 a year. This is equal to \u00a3616.67 a month (after tax and not including any benefits you get) to qualify for benefits-related Free School Meals (FSM)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are entitled to Working Tax Credit (apart from during the four-week run-on period), you will not qualify for FSM, even if you have a low income.</p>\n<p>If you are receiving Child Tax Credit only, your annual income must be less than \u00a316,190 to qualify.</p>\n<p>If your family has No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF), you may also be entitled to free meals. Please speak with your child\u2019s school about this.</p>\n<h2>Apply for free school meals</h2>\n<p>To apply for Free School Meals, please speak with your child's school.</p>\n<p>You will need to provide the school with:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>your full name</li>\n    <li>your date of birth and</li>\n    <li>your National Insurance (NI) number or asylum support reference number</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your child's school will then share your details with City of Wolverhampton Council. We check eligibility using a secure Government website.</p>\n<p>If we find you eligible for FSM, your child's school will let you know. If we don\u2019t find you eligible, we will continue to check your eligibility.</p>\n<p>Schools receive valuable Government funding (Pupil Premium) for every child registered for FSM. Even if your child chooses not to eat school meals, we would still encourage you to register.</p>\n<h2>Starting or moving school</h2>\n<p>If your child is due to start school in Reception in September, or any other year group and they don\u2019t already have a benefits-related Free School Meals (FSM) claim in place, you will need to provide your details (full name, date of birth and National Insurance (NI) or asylum support reference number) to your child\u2019s school. Your details will be shared with us for eligibility checking in readiness for the start of the new academic year.</p>\n<p>If your child is due to move school and already has a benefits-related Free School Meals (FSM) claim in place, you do not need to apply again.</p>\n<p>Your child\u2019s entitlement to free meals should be communicated between schools through their Common Transfer File (CTF). Schools in Wolverhampton can also contact us to confirm any claims on our secure database.</p>\n<p>Your child\u2019s new school may request additional information from you for your child\u2019s claim to be recorded.</p>\n<p>Please contact your child\u2019s school with any questions about school meals.

Pupils becoming eligible for free school meals under the benefits-based criteria in this time, will continue to receive free meals until the end of the 2025/26 school year.</p>\n<p>This applies, regardless of any change in household circumstances, including an increase in earnings above the eligibility threshold.</p>\n<p>From the start of the 2026/27 academic year, it is the Department for Education\u2019s intention that all protections will be discontinued, alongside an extension to the eligibility criteria for free school meals. From this point, households must meet the eligibility criteria to be entitled to free school meals.</p>\n<p>While transitional protections are in effect, schools and local authorities do not need to keep eligibility for free school meals under continued review. This applies until the end of the 2025/26 school year.</p>\n<p>It is the Department for Education\u2019s intention to discontinue transitional protections from the start of the 2026/27 school year. From this point, households will need to meet the eligibility criteria in order to be entitled to a free meal.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of the 2026/27 academic year, schools and local authorities will need to keep free school meal eligibility under continued review. Schools and local authorities should recheck eligibility for all pupils in receipt of free meals, ahead of the October census.</p>\n<p>The Department does not expect rechecks of eligibility to be carried out more than once a year to prevent families from experiencing any sudden loss of entitlement during the school year.</p>\n<p>If you no longer qualify through NASS or Pension Credit, you should tell your child\u2019s school or the FSM Eligibility Checking Service direct. We will then recheck your eligibility.</p>\n<p>Transitional Protection does not apply to siblings who don\u2019t have a claim registered in their own name. This means some of your children may be entitled to free meals but others aren\u2019t.</p>\n<h2>Universal Infant Free School Meals (UIFSM)</h2>\n<p>Under the Government\u2019s UIFSM scheme, all children in Reception, Years 1 and 2 can enjoy school meals during term-time for free, regardless of their family\u2019s financial circumstances.</p>\n<p>UIFSM are not the same as benefits-related Free School Meals (FSM).</p>\n<p>You do not need to register for UIFSM.</p>\n<p>Your child's school may ask if your child will be taking meals so that they can make the necessary arrangements.</p>\n<h2>School menus</h2>\n<p>Please ask your child/ren\u2019s school/s any questions you have about your child/ren\u2019s school meals.</p>\n<p>Arrangements and school meal providers vary across the City.</p>\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"/node/10952\">School Menus</a> for information about school meals provided by the Council.</p>\n<h2>Contact us</h2>\n<p>If you have any other questions about free meals, please email: <a href=\"mailto:freeschoolmeals@wolverhampton.gov.uk\">freeschoolmeals@wolverhampton.gov.uk</a> or contact your child\u2019s school.</p>\n```",
