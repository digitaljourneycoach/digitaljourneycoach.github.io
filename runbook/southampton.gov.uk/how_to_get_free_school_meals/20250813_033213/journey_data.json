The impact has been shown to last well into adulthood, with evidence linking FSM to improved educational attainment and a host of social, financial, and health benefits.</p>\n<p>It also enables those eligible children and families to access many other benefits, such as access to <a href=\"/schools-learning/support-inclusion-education/haf/\" title=\"HAF\">holiday activities</a> and also the pupil premium funding for schools, below.</p>\n\n<h2>What are the benefits of Free School Meals?</h2>\n<h2>A helping hand amidst rising living costs</h2>\n<p>Some children rely on their FSM as their only hot meal of the day, and for some, it may be their only meal.</p>\n<p>Families with primary school children can save up to <strong>\u00a3450</strong> a year through free school meals, nearly \u00a340 a month, while the savings are higher for secondary school students.</p>\n<p>Those who are eligible for free school meals also get access to our Holiday, Activity and Food (HAF) programme. This programme offers free childcare, activities and groups for school aged pupils during the Easter, summer, and Christmas holidays. It means that each child could have access to up to <strong>\u00a3840 of free activities</strong> across the year. Find out more <a href=\"/schools-learning/support-inclusion-education/haf/\" title=\"HAF\">about HAF</a>.</p>\n<p>Providing FSM to all children from families on universal credit not only offers financial relief but also emotional support for parents knowing that their child will receive a nourishing meal.</p>\n<p>We know some families have to make huge sacrifices, but having the option of a FSM can be such a relief.</p>\n\n<h2>Improving access to education</h2>\n<p>Hunger affects behaviour as blood sugar levels drop, leading to irritability and emotional reactions. A balanced, hot meal during the day nourishes children, stabilises blood sugar levels, helps them stay calm, and behave better, reducing disruptions and enhancing their school experience.</p>\n<p>Hungry children struggle with tiredness, emotional instability, and distraction, hindering their ability to concentrate and retain information. Nutritious meals provide slow-release energy, promoting focused and effective learning.</p>\n\n<h2>Providing essential nutrients for growth and development</h2>\n<p>School meals meet strict nutritional standards, offering vital nutrients for healthy growth and development. Balanced meals can help combat illnesses and oral health issues stemming from poor diets, supporting children's overall wellbeing.</p>\n<p>In addition to nutrition, the emotional support of comforting meals like lasagne or a roast dinner can provide a sense of warmth and security, especially on cold days. A wholesome meal can be like a comforting hug in the middle of the day, nourishing the soul and providing much-needed comfort for children.</p>\n\n<h2>Promoting healthy eating habits early on</h2>\n<p>Encouraging healthy eating habits from a young age is vital for lifelong well-being and disease prevention. Introducing nutritious meals at school can instil healthy eating habits and reduce the risk of diet-related illnesses in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Children may be entitled to receive these at school if they are of compulsory school age and applicants meet the below criteria.</p>\n<h2>How to apply for free school meals</h2>\n<p>If your child is of <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions/school-starting-age\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"School starting age\">compulsory school age</a>, we recommend you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/southampton/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Free school meals eligibility check\">Apply online for an eligibility check</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/schools-learning/find-school/schools/\" title=\"Schools in Southampton\">Contact the school that your child attends</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parents/guardians should see each relevant guidance section below before applying.</p>\n<p>Children below compulsory school age within full-time education may be able to secure additional education provider funding, we recommend discussing this with your provider.</p>\n<p>Free meals may also be available to post-16 pupils following similar criteria as below, to apply please contact the institution directly.</p>\n<p>Parents/guardians, and in some instances the child themselves, can become FSM eligible by meeting the criteria in both (A) and (B) sections as follows:</p>\n\n<h3>A) There must be a valid FSM application associated with the receiving child</h3>\n<p>This can either be completed by the applicant (parent/guardian/child) or by the child\u2019s school on their behalf. We recommend schools have a privacy policy that supports this.</p>\n\n<h3>B) The applicant (parent/guardian/child) meets any of the following criteria</h3>\n<h2>Is in receipt of one or more eligible benefits</h2>\n<p>The applicant is in receipt of at least one of the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Universal Credit</strong> \u2013 must have annual net income of \u00a37,400 or less (after tax and not including other benefits), assessed by statements up to the three most recent assessments periods</li>\n<li><strong>Asylum Support</strong> \u2013 as per Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>\n<li><strong>Pension Credit</strong> \u2013 recipient of the guarantee (main) element</li>\n<li><strong>Child Tax Credit</strong> \u2013 applicants from before Universal Credit rollout; provided you\u2019re not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of \u00a316,190 or less</li>\n<li><strong>Working Tax Credit run-on</strong> \u2013 paid for four weeks after you stop qualifying (applicants from before Universal Credit rollout)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Is covered by Transition Protection following the Universal Credit rollout from 1 April 2018</h2>\n<p>This only applies to those pupils who might have otherwise lost free school meals eligibility following the rollout of Universal Credit, as from 1 April 2018. Transitional Protections would cover pupils until the end of their current school phase and may require providing the school with official Universal Credit statements to support your eligibility claim.</p>\n<p>See below for details.</p>\n\n<h2>Is from an identified family group with No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF)</h2>\n<p>The child is from an identified family group with No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) and their annual household income is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less than \u00a322,700 for families outside London with one child, or</li>\n<li>Less than \u00a326,300 for families outside London with two or more children</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This very small cohort of families should check Department of Education (DfE) guidance to see if they qualify.</p>\n\n<h2>Specific guidance</h2>\n<h2>Pupils in Reception, Year 1, and Year 2</h2>\n<p>All pupils in Reception, Year 1 or Year 2 are automatically entitled to receive a school meal under the Universal Infant Free Meals policy, if they attend both the morning and afternoon schooling periods.</p>\n<p>Please note, <strong>Universal Infant Free Meals</strong> is NOT the same as <strong>Free School Meal eligibility</strong>. Only claimants that meet the criteria seen above entitle schools to claim for FSM funding.</p>\n<p>We still recommend parents apply for Free School Meals if you think you meet the criteria. This will mean your child's school won\u2019t miss out on important funding to support your child (Pupil Premium) and may also enable your child to continue receiving free school meals after Year 2.</p>\n\n<h2>Free meals in further education (FE) funded institutions</h2>\n<p>As well as the eligibility criteria seen above, post-16 students must be enrolled in further education provision funded via ESFA to be eligible for a free meal. Eligible institutions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General further education colleges, including specialist colleges</li>\n<li>Sixth-form colleges</li>\n<li>Commercial and charitable providers</li>\n<li>Higher education institutions (HEIs) with 16 to 19 funding from ESFA</li>\n<li>Specialist post-16 institutions (SPIs)</li>\n<li>Local authorities (LAs) and FE institutions directly funded for 16 to 19</li>\n<li>16 to 18 traineeship providers</li>\n<li>European Social Fund (ESF) only institutions</li>\n<li>16 to 19 only academies and free schools</li>\n<li>16 to 19 only maintained schools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note how this does not include apprentices. A student must be aged 16 or over to be eligible to receive a free meal. Students aged 19 or over are only eligible to receive a free meal if they are continuing on a study programme they began aged 16 to 18 (19+ continuers) or have an EHCP.</p>\n\n<h2>Transitional protection</h2>\n<p>From 1 April 2018, transitional protection was implemented for those pupils who might otherwise have lost free school meals following the rollout of Universal Credit eligibility. Note how this protection covers eligibility via Universal Credit benefits only, and none of the other eligibilities listed above.</p>\n<p>If your child is eligible for free school meals, they will remain eligible until they finish the phase of schooling they are in as at Summer 2023*.</p>\n<p>The transitional protections may be awarded as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any pupil who is in receipt of free school meals immediately prior to 1 April 2018 will continue to receive free school meals whilst Universal Credit is rolled out. This applies even if they no longer meet the eligibility criteria during that time</li>\n<li>Any pupil who gains eligibility for free school meals after 1 April 2018 will continue to receive free school meals during the Universal Credit rollout period. This applies even if they no longer meet the eligibility criteria at a subsequent point during the rollout period</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once Universal Credit is fully rolled out, any existing pupil who no longer meets the eligibility criteria at that point will continue to receive free school meals until the end of their current phase of education (Year 6 for Primary, Year 11 for Secondary, or aged 18 for FE).</p>\n<p>Please also note how the Online Eligibility checker service does not check for historical eligibility denoting transitional protections. We recommend discussing these instances with the school and providing supporting Universal Credit statements as evidence where necessary.</p>\n<p>*Please note how this date has been extended from March 2022 and could be extended further.</p>\n\n<h2>Further guidance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools-and-local-authorities\" target=\"_blank\">Official FSM Guidance from the Department for Education</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/free-meals-in-further-education-funded-institutions-guide-for-the-2021-to-2022-academic-year\" target=\"_blank\">Official FSM Guidance in FE Institutions from ESFA</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/get-extra-early-years-funding\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Extra funding for your Early Years provider\">Extra funding for your Early Years provider</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Pupil premium</h2>\n<p>Established in 2011, the pupil premium is an annual governmental contribution to schools aiming to enhance the academic performance of underprivileged students. Families receiving specific benefits often entitle their children to a financial allocation aimed at enhancing their educational experience.</p>\n<p>Children eligible for the pupil premium often encounter obstacles to meeting their potential. The primary aim of the pupil premium is to directly benefit these students, reducing the achievement gap.</p>\n<p>Primary schools receive pupil premium funding for various categories of pupils, including those currently or previously entitled to FSM, children in care, and children from service families. Schools determine how to allocate their pupil premium funds, aiming to best serve the needs of their eligible students.</p>\n<p>Common uses of the pupil premium include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing additional classroom support</li>\n<li>Employing extra teaching assistants</li>\n<li>Organising extra learning times</li>\n<li>Offering extracurricular activities</li>\n<li>Investing in resources to improve outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Schools must show how they are spending the pupil premium and how that is improving the outcomes for these pupils.</p>\n<p>All children qualifying for FSM due to family circumstances automatically qualify for the pupil premium. If you feel you may qualify, speak to your child\u2019s school.</p>\n<p>Additionally, students who previously qualified for FSM within the last six years continue to receive pupil premium benefits. Schools and the local authority are responsible for identifying eligible students. In the first instance, you should speak to your child\u2019s school, but across the year, Southampton City Council may contact those families who may be eligible. If in doubt, please ask or <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/southampton\" target=\"_blank\">use the eligibility checker</a>.</p>\n<p>Parents are encouraged to inform the school if their child is eligible for FSM or has been in the past. This information enables schools to claim pupil premium funding to support the educational needs of disadvantaged students.</p>\n\n<h2>Healthy packed lunches</h2>\n<p>Schools play a crucial role in promoting the health and well-being of children. Healthy eating habits are established early in life, and proper nutrition during childhood can prevent various health issues in the short and long term.</p>\n<p>Concerns are rising about children consuming excessive fat, sugar, and salt, while lacking fibre, fruits, and vegetables. School meals must comply with the Government School Food Standards introduced in 2015 to ensure nutritious options for children. These standards include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily inclusion of one or more portions of vegetables</li>\n<li>Emphasis on wholegrain foods instead of refined carbohydrates</li>\n<li>Limiting pastry products to two portions per week</li>\n<li>Daily inclusion of one or more portions of fruit</li>\n<li>Availability of drinking water</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no equivalent standards for packed lunches, and a recent survey revealed that very few packed lunches meet the School Food Standards. Most packed lunches contain unhealthy snacks like chocolate and sweets, sugary drinks, and high-fat, high-salt savoury snacks.</p>\n<p>Packed lunches can contribute significantly to a child's weekly food intake, so it is essential to encourage healthy choices for children who bring their lunches. This guidance aims to assist parents in preparing nutritious packed lunches to support their child's well-being.</p>\n<p>We have put together a <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/media/xkrf4wfa/scc-healthy-packed-lunches-a-guidance-for-parents-and-guardians-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Healthy Packed Lunches, Guidance For Parents And Guardians\">downloadable guidance document for parents and guardians</a> to help offer some advice on what some healthy choices could be.</p>\n```",
