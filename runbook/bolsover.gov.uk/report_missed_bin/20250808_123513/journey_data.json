Inside this section, there's an iframe with ID \"self-application-iframe\" which contains the central editorial content of the page.\n\nTo extract only the cleaned, semantically structured HTML containing the central editorial content of the page, I'll focus on the contents of the iframe:\n\n```html\n<iframe name=\"self-application-iframe\" id=\"missedbin\" title=\"Main Content\" class=\"self-app-iframe hide\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 0;overflow: hidden;\" seamless=\"seamless\" src=\"/appshost/firmstep/self/apps/custompage/missedbin?language=en\">\n   <!-- here is the central editorial content -->\n</iframe>\n```\n\nNow let's extract the iframe content by replacing the `<iframe>` tags with their inner content. In this specific example, we don't have any markup or non-content elements that require additional cleaning:\n\n```html\n<!-- cleaned HTML -->\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head></head>\n<body>\n\t<!-- here is the central editorial content -->\n</body>\n</html>\n\n<!-- central editorial content -->\n<div id=\"self-precontent\"></div>\n<section class=\"container\">\n   <iframe name=\"missedbin\" title=\"Missed Bin\" class=\"self-app-iframe hide\" src=\"/appshost/firmstep/self/apps/custompage/missedbin?language=en\"></iframe>\n</section>\n```\n\nIn this example, I provided the cleaned HTML structure containing the central editorial content. If needed, further cleaning can be applied to remove non-essential `<script>`, `<style>`, and other elements inside the iframe depending on their relevance to the extracted content.",
