When a user clicks on these smiley faces, they are directed to a specific survey rating page for that level of satisfaction.\n\nThe code also includes Accessibility features like \"visually-hidden\" classes and ARIA labels for improving the web accessibility by making the content more understandable to assistive technologies like screen readers.\n\nHowever, as a text-based AI model, I don't have the ability to visualize or interact with webpages, but this HTML code gives us an idea of its structure and purpose.",
