The language attribute specifies that the content is written in English.\n3. `<head><meta charset=\"UTF-8\">` - Sets the character encoding to UTF-8, ensuring compatibility with various languages and symbols.\n4. `<title>Survey Results</title>` - Provides the title for the webpage, as displayed in browser tabs and search results.\n5. Various link tags (linked stylesheet and scripts) are used to load external resources required by the page such as fonts and JavaScript files.\n6. `<style>` element defines CSS styles applicable to the entire webpage. In this case, it sets some basic styling properties like fonts, colors, margins, and padding.\n7. Use of multiple div elements for organizing and grouping content into various sections such as the survey container, voting results, voting buttons (poor, average, good), and the overall rating (smiley faces).\n8. Inside the vote-container div, three divs are used to represent each smiley face button corresponding to poor, average, and good ratings. Each of these has a corresponding onClick event that triggers a JavaScript function.\n9. The JavaScript code is placed within script tags. It handles the click events on the voting buttons, sends an AJAX request to the specified endpoint for rating submission, and updates the overall rating (using smiley faces) accordingly.\n10. `<div id=\"results\">` contains the HTML structure for displaying the survey results using a series of div elements with various CSS classes. Inside this container, three sets of smiley faces are displayed based on the scores received for poor, average, and good ratings. The scores are represented as numbers (e.g., 127), percentages (e.g., 25%), and emojis (e.g., \u2639, \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, \ud83d\ude0a).\n11. `<footer>` element provides information about the website source code and license.",
