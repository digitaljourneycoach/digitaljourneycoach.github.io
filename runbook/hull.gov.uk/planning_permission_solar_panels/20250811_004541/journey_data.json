                        "content": "```html\n<h1>Ella Street Conservation Area Public Consultation</h1>\n\n<p>This project has concluded.</p>\n\n<p>Ella Street Conservation Area provides heritage protection for the residential suburb of Ella Street, developed in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods.</p>\n\n<p>Designated a Conservation Area in 1994, the special interest of the area is formed by its late 19th century and early 20th century built environment and its historic layout.</p>\n\n<p>The Conservation Area has not been reviewed since its adoption and to date a Character Appraisal for the area has not been adopted. As part of the ongoing re-surveys of all of Hull\u2019s Conservation Areas, Ella Street has been selected as the seventh area to be reviewed and to undergo public consultation.</p>\n\n<p>Public consultation is being undertaken on the following proposals -</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Changes to the designated boundary of the Ella Street Conservation Area</li>\n    <li>The adoption of a Conservation Area \u2018Character Appraisal and Management Plan\u2019</li>\n    <li>The adoption of an Article 4 Direction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What is a Conservation Area</h2>\n\n<p>A \u2018Conservation Area\u2019 is a designated area of special architectural or historic interest relating to the heritage of the City of Hull. Hull City Council currently have 26 designated <a href=\"https://www.hull.gov.uk/building-standards-regulations/conservation-areas\">Conservation Areas</a>. The designation removes certain permitted development rights associated with the demolition and alteration of buildings. It introduces additional requirements for new development for buildings and land located within the boundary of the Conservation Area. It also introduces controls over the felling and pruning of trees. Applications for development within a Conservation Area, and its setting, are assessed by specific heritage policies and legislation.</p>\n\n<h2>What Boundary Changes are Being Proposed</h2>\n\n<p>Three areas are being proposed for removal from the Ella Street Conservation Area.</p>\n\n<p>It is considered that the areas do not contribute towards the special interest of the Ella Street Conservation Area and do not warrant being within the designated boundary of the conservation area.</p>\n\n<p>These three areas include -</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Ella Street even numbers 194 to 204</li>\n    <li>2 St Ninian\u2019s Walk</li>\n    <li>Sanderson Close numbers 1 to 23</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://yoursay.hull.gov.uk/36612/widgets/107261/documents/70524\">Access the existing conservation area boundary maps</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a Character Appraisal</h2>\n\n<p>To inform on the special interest and reasons why an area is designated as a Conservation Area, a Council can adopt a \u2018Character Appraisal\u2019 document. A character appraisal will include information such as a definition of the special interest of the Conservation Area. It will explain the character of its built and natural environment and will identify key elements such as buildings, open spaces and views. A character appraisal can be prepared as a joint document or separately with a \u2018Management Plan\u2019 document.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a Management Plan</h2>\n\n<p>A Management Plan provides guidance on how development should take place within the Conservation Area. It includes guidance on what features should be retained and how elements such as advertising should be introduced. It can also identify positive and negative trends within a Conservation Area and propose management tools for reversing or promoting such trends.</p>\n\n<h2>What is in the new Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan</h2>\n\n<p>The new Character Appraisal and Management Plan (CAMP) includes the following elements -</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>A definition of the individual elements of special interest in the Conservation Area</li>\n    <li>A historic and archaeological assessment of the area</li>\n    <li>An assessment of the designated boundary of the area</li>\n    <li>A review of the character of the built and natural environment of the area</li>\n    <li>The grading of buildings by their contribution towards the special interest of the conservation area</li>\n    <li>The identification of positive architectural features which contribute towards the character and appearance in the area</li>\n    <li>The contribution made by the natural environment to the area</li>\n    <li>The importance of the setting of the heritage asset</li>\n    <li>Positive and negative trends within the area</li>\n    <li>Opportunities for further development</li>\n    <li>Management guidance for the conservation area</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A copy of the <a href=\"https://yoursay.hull.gov.uk/36612/widgets/107261/documents/70526\">Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan is available for download</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens when a Character Appraisal and Management Plan is Adopted</h2>\n\n<p>Once a Character Appraisal and Management Plan have been agreed they form a \u2018material consideration\u2019 in the determination of planning and advertisement control applications. This means that an application for development or alteration to a building within a Conservation Area should be determined in accordance with the Character Appraisal and Management Plan.</p>\n\n<h2>What is an Article 4 Direction</h2>\n\n<p>An Article 4 Direction is a planning tool that the Council can introduce to withdraw or alter Permitted Development rights within the 2015 General Permitted Development Order (GDPO). For example, within a Conservation Area, the GDPO allows for a resident to change the colour of the property, but an Article 4 Direction could be introduced to require planning permission to paint a property blue.</p>\n\n<h2>What Article 4 Directions are Being Proposed</h2>\n\n<p>Proposals are being made for the adoption of two Article 4 Directions to withdraw the following sections of the 2015 GDPO:</p>\n\n<h3>Rooflights</h3>\n\n<p>Schedule 2 - Part 1 Development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse Class A - enlargement, improvement or other alteration of a dwellinghouse.</p>\n\n<p>Permitted Development - A The enlargement, improvement or other alteration of a dwellinghouse where (k) it would consist of or include - (iv) an alteration to any part of the roof of the dwellinghouse.</p>\n\n<p>This would apply to the full extent of the Conservation Area, as retained following the proposed boundary amendments, and introduce a requirement for Planning Permission where an alteration would include the installation of a roof light (a window that is incorporated as part of the design of the roof) on a roof elevation facing a highway.</p>\n\n<h3>Solar Panels</h3>\n\n<p>Schedule 2 Part 1 \u2013 Development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse - Class C \u2013 other alterations to the roof of a dwellinghouse</p>\n\n<p>Permitted development - C. Any other alteration to the roof of a dwellinghouse.</p>\n\n<p>This would apply to the full extent of the Conservation Area, as retained following the proposed boundary amendments, and introduce a requirement for Planning Permission for the installation of solar panels (where less than 0.15m) where on a roof elevation facing a highway.</p>\n\n<p>In both instances, a highway is being defined as the public highway and the access way between the Court Housing.</p>\n\n<h2>Why is an Article 4 Direction Being Proposed</h2>\n\n<p>Negative trends and further threats to the Conservation Area have been identified as a result of the potential to change the roofs of buildings fronting the public highway within the Conservation Area. It is considered that the introduction of large numbers of roof lights or solar panels has the potential to negatively impact the special interest of the Conservation Area.</p>\n\n<h2>What are the Impacts of the Introduction of Article 4</h2>\n\n<p>If the new Article 4 Direction is introduced there will be a requirement to apply for planning permission to install a roof light or solar panel on a roof elevation facing a highway. Standard planning fees will apply for <a href=\"https://www.hull.gov.uk/planning-applications/planning-application-fees\">planning applications</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>When the Article 4 Directions be Adopted</h2>\n\n<p>Plans for the Article 4 directions will progress depending upon what feedback is received from residents. If a strong objection is raised this will be declared to Members and a decision will be made whether to adopt the Article 4 direction or not. This will take around four to six months after public consultation ends.</p>\n```",
