User starts by selecting whether their overall experience was good or poor.\na. If 'good', they are guided to identify the specific aspects of the website that made the experience positive by choosing one or more options from a list of potential issues (e.g., easy to find, easy to understand, etc.). They also have the option to provide additional feedback about anything not already mentioned.\nb. If 'poor', they are prompted to select one or more reasons for their dissatisfaction, again from a predefined list (e.g., hard to find, hard to understand, etc.). They can also add additional feedback if needed.\n2. User's feedback is then recorded in the provided text fields and submitted by clicking on the 'Next' button.",
