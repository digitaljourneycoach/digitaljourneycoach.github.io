This form asks the user how they feel about a specific page (it seems like it is related to council services based on some of the options), providing them with multiple choice options (\"It was hard to find\", \"It doesn't have the information I need\", etc.) and a text area for more detailed feedback. After selecting their options, users can submit their responses.\n\nHere's a breakdown of components in the code:\n\n1. **form**: The form provides the structure for the user input fields and handles submission.\n2. **input fields**: Several fields are used for collecting user information, such as the type of feedback and additional comments they might have.\n3. **select elements (radios)**: This allows users to choose one specific answer from a set of predefined options. Each option has its corresponding id, name, and value.\n4. **textarea** (for detailed feedback): A text area is used when longer input is required from the user for more detailed or expansive comments.\n5. **submit button**: This enables users to submit their responses after filling out the form.\n6. **Form actions**: Various hidden and non-visible fields are used by the system for handling form submission (e.g., `form_build_id`, `form_id`, and an anti-bot token).\n7. **CSS classes** (e.g., `govuk-form-group`): These classes help manage the appearance of the form elements, ensuring a uniform look and feel across the website.",
