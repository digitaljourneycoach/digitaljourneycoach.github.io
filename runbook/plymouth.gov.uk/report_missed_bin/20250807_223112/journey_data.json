A question asking if the user found the information helpful, with two radio buttons (Yes/No) for response.\n2. A set of Yes/No radio buttons related to different services and contact details if the user selected 'No' in the first step.\n3. An optional comment box for further feedback if the user chose 'No' in the first step or selected a service requiring feedback in the second step.\n4. A submission button to send the form once filled out.\n\nThe email sign-up form is separate from the feedback form, and it allows users to subscribe to newsletters and updates from Plymouth City Council. Users can enter their email address, and upon clicking the 'Sign Up' button, they subscribe to the service.",
