If the user selects 'No' for the 'Was this page helpful?' question, there are some follow-up questions asking for more detailed feedback such as the reason for their dissatisfaction or a suggestion for improvement.\n\n3. Irrespective of whether the user finds the page helpful or not, they are given an option to submit more general feedback in a comments box.\n\n4. Once the form is submitted, it sends the feedback to the site owners (Plymouth City Council) for review and potential action.\n\n5.
