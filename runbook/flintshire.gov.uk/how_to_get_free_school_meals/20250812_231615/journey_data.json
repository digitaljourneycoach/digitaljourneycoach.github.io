There will be no forms to fill in.</p>\n<p><strong>Receiving a UPFSM in this way does not automatically entitle families to receive other benefits such as school essentials grants.</strong></p>\n<p>For more information on UPFSM go to <a href=\"/en/Resident/Schools/Free-School-Meals.aspx\">Universal Primary Free School Meals</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Free School Meals (eFSM)</strong> - Some families who meet certain criteria, for example those on lower incomes or in receipt of certain benefits, are entitled to receive a free school meal (eFSM).</p>\n<p>On a successful application for eFSM families are then eligible for other benefits to cover the cost of school essentials such as school essentials grants (PDG).</p>\n<p>Even though the roll out of UPFSM will begin in September 2022, and eligible year groups will begin to receive free school meals, families who are eligible for eFSM should continue to use the eFSM application process to ensure they don't lose out on other benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"h4\">What is Free School Meals (eFSM) Policy?</p>\n<p>Free school meals (eFSM) will be provided for pupils whose parents receive:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Income Support,</li>\n  <li>Income Based Jobseekers Allowance,</li>\n  <li>Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999,</li>\n  <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance,</li>\n  <li>Child Tax Credit, provided they are not entitled to Working Tax Credit and their annual income does not exceed &pound;16,190,</li>\n  <li>Guarantee element of State Pension Credit,</li>\n  <li>Working Tax Credit 'run-on' - the payment someone may receive for a further four weeks after they stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit or Universal Credit.</li>\n  <li>Universal credit(If earned income is included in the assessment of UC it must be less than &pound;616.66).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How do I apply for eFSM?</h4>\n<p>You must complete an <a href=\"https://digital.flintshire.gov.uk/FCC_SchoolAdmissions\">online form to apply for free school meals</a> (eFSM).</p>\n<p>If you are an Asylum Seeker and/or have no recourse to public funds, please do not try and apply online. Instead, please email us with your name, address, date of birth and contact details, and we will contact you to help you apply.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"h3\">Frequently Asked Questions</p>\n<p class=\"h4\">My child lives in Flintshire but attends school outside of Flintshire. Where do I claim Free School Meals (eFSM) from?</p>\n<p>This is an area where we receive many queries. Our grant conditions for Free School Meal (eFSM) funding tell us that the Council responsible for the school where the child attends is where the parent should claim from.</p>\n<p>As an example, if a child lives in Gronant (Flintshire) but attends a school in Prestatyn (Denbighshire), Free School Meals (eFSM) funding would be the responsibility of Denbighshire County Council so the parent must apply to Denbighshire. This is exactly the same for school essentials grant (PDG).</p>\n<p>However, if a child lives in Flintshire but attends school in a neighbouring, English County (such as Chester), then we have special conditions from Welsh Government introduced in August 2022 that allow us to assess such cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note, as this change was made in August 2022, Welsh Government have told us that we cannot overturn refusals for this reason from prior years. We would therefore appreciate parents understanding in this regard and refrain from asking us to overturn previous decisions.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"h4\">I should have applied earlier and have missed out on payments for holidays as a result. If I apply now, can it be backdated?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately not. The policy that governs Free School Meals (eFSM) expressly states that backdating is not permitted.</p>\n<p>We often receive queries and complaints in this area but regret that we have no discretion to award backdating.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"h4\">I am a foster carer, can I claim Free School Meals (eFSM) for the child I foster?</p>\n<p>Yes \u2013 Please follow the link on this page.</p>\n<p>When you are filling in the online form, there is an income selection for \u2018Foster Allowance\u2019.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"h4\">My child is enrolled with a Flintshire school but does not attend school for a given reason, such as health issues, disability, exclusion etc. Can I be paid for eFSM instead?</p>\n<p>No \u2013 eFSM is about the provision of a meal for a child and this is something that Welsh Government (WG) are very firm on.</p>\n<p>We may be able to make alterations to meal provisions, such as making a packed lunch available that can be collected by the parent, but this is in exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>Please contact us if you would like more information about this.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"h4\">I have a child or another child starting school in September. Will they automatically get free school meals?</p>\n<p>If your child is starting reception class in September, they will automatically qualify for the new, Universal Primary Free School Meals (UPFSM).</p>\n<p>However, if the parent is in receipt of a certain income (see bullet points above), they must still apply for Free School Meals (eFSM). This is because if they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t be able to access other funding, such as school essentials grant (PDG).</p>\n<p>We have more information about this <a href=\"https://www.flintshire.gov.uk/en/Resident/Schools/Free-School-Meals.aspx\">here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"h4\">Why is it important to apply?</p>\n<p>If you are eligible to receive free school meals (eFSM) it is very important to your child\u2019s school that you apply.
