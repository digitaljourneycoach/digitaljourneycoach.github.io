All meals are nutritionally balanced and are served by friendly catering staff. Children can sit down together and enjoy their meal whilst at the same time developing social skills of eating together that are so important in later life. A well fed and happy child is more likely to be receptive to participating in the afternoon's activities. Convenience. Someone else preparing and cooking lunch for your child saves you worrying about a packed meal every day.</p>\n<p><strong>Universal Infant Free School Meals</strong></p>\n<p>From September schools will be offering all children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 a free school meal. The Government are introducing Infant Free School Meals following an independent review of school food which found that where all children had been given a free school meal they were months ahead of their peers in their school work. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-infant-free-school-meals-guide-for-schools-and-local-authorities\" target=\"_blank\">Government website</a></p>\n<h2>How to Pay for Your Child's School Meals</h2>\n<p>You can now <a href=\"https://public.tameside.gov.uk/forms/f1005PaySchoolMeals559.asp\">pay for your school meals on-line here using a credit/debit card</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also pay by sending dinner money into school on a weekly basis. The school will advise which day of the week is most convenient (usually each Monday).</p>\n<h2>How to Apply for Free School Meals</h2>\n<p>Free School Meals can be claimed by Parents or Guardians of pupil's who are on a low income. All claims will be processed by your child\u2019s school.</p>\n<p>Eligible income includes:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Universal Credit, provided they have an annual net earned income not exceeding \u00a37,400(\u00a3616.67 per month)</li>\n    <li>Income Support</li>\n    <li>Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance</li>\n    <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>\n    <li>Support under Part 6 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>\n    <li>The guarantee element of Pension Credit</li>\n    <li>Child Tax Credit, provided they are not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than \u00a316,190, as assessed by HMRC</li>\n    <li>Working Tax Credit run-on - paid 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tameside Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/sims-tameside\">https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/sims-tameside</a></p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Alder Community High School</li>\n    <li>All Saints Catholic College</li>\n    <li>Arlies Primary School</li>\n    <!-- Additional school names omitted for brevity -->\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SIMS Main Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/sims\">https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/sims</a></p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Ashton West End Primary Academy</li>\n    <li>Audenshaw School</li>\n    <!-- Additional school names omitted for brevity -->\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Victorious Academies:</strong> <a href=\"https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/victoriousacademies\">https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/victoriousacademies</a></p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Aldwyn Primary School</li>\n    <li>Arundale Primary School</li>\n    <!-- Additional school names omitted for brevity -->\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Entrust Academies:</strong> <a href=\"https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/entrust\">https://apply.cloudforedu.org.uk/ofsm/entrust</a></p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Oasis Academy, Broadoak</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For</strong> Parochial Church of England Primary School enquire within school office to apply</p>\n<h2>If You Currently Don\u2019t Claim Free School Meals</h2>\n<p>Free School Meals can be claimed by Parents or Guardians of pupil's who are on a low income. All claims will be processed by your child\u2019s school. Eligible income includes:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Universal Credit, provided they have an annual net earned income not exceeding \u00a37,400(\u00a3616.67 per month)</li>\n    <li>Income Support</li>\n    <!-- Additional eligibility criteria omitted for brevity -->\n</ul>\n<h2>If You Currently Don\u2019t Claim Free School Meal</h2>\n<p>If you think you might be eligible for free school meals, submit a claim to your child\u2019s school. Your school should have a form you can use. The Information you provide will be used to check if you are in receipt of a qualifying benefit and, if you are on Universal Credit, that your earnings do not exceed the threshold. If you claim Universal Credit, your earnings will be assessed from up to three of your last Universal Credit assessment periods.</p>\n<p>If you are eligible, your child will receive free school meals and the school will receive extra funding.</p>\n<h2>If You Already Claim Free School Meal</h2>\n<p>Most people won't be affected by the new criteria. If you're currently claiming free school meals, but don't meet the new criteria, your child will continue to receive free school meals until the end of the Universal Credit rollout period. This will apply even if your earnings rise above the new threshold or if you stop being entitled to Universal Credit. The rollout period is currently scheduled to end March 2023. Once Universal Credit is fully rolled out, your child will keep their free school meal until the end of their current phase of education, i.e. primary or secondary.</p>\n<h2>Special diets</h2>\n<p>You should contact your school if you have any special dietary requirements. Medical diets can be provided. Please let your school know if your child has been prescribed a medical diet. Should you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact us so that we can help your child enjoy their lunch.</p>\n<p>On 13th December 2014, the Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 (EU FIC) changes the way allergen information appears on labels and on food that is prepacked, sold loose or served out of home. From this date caterers must be able to answer any consumer queries regarding the 14 major food allergens that have been identified as issues for people living across Europe.</p>\n```",
