Inside the cookieConsents container, there are four sections for Marketing cookies, Statistics cookies, Preferences cookies, and Additional cookies. These sections allow users to manage their preferences, such as agreeing or disagreeing to the use of certain types of cookies.\n3. Each section contains a brief description of the corresponding type of cookie and a switch that enables or disables each category based on user preference.\n4. There are two submit buttons: one for saving custom settings (customSettingsSubmit) and another for using the recommended settings (recommendedSettingsSubmit).\n5. The close button and modal properties are set to prevent closing the container after clicking anywhere except the close button or Esc key. This ensures that users cannot accidentally dismiss the cookie consent notification until they have made their preferences clear.",
