We are more than just a food bank, we are a welcoming, supermarket-style space where those in need can access essential groceries at significantly reduced costs.</p>\n\n<p>Supported by Dartford Borough Council in partnership with Crossways Community Church, New Avenues, and The Healthy Living Centre, <a href=\"https://www.dartfordlarder.co.uk/\">Dartford Larder</a> is committed to restoring dignity and empowering people to take control of their circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside providing food, we offer a range of cooking classes, financial guidance, and connections to local organisations that can help with employment, housing, and wellbeing. Our goal is to create a supportive environment where everyone\u2014whether working but struggling, on benefits, or facing temporary difficulties\u2014can find the help they need.</p>\n\n<p>We believe in building a stronger, more resilient community\u2014one where no one has to face hardship alone. <a href=\"https://www.dartfordlarder.co.uk/\">Dartford Larder</a> is here to help, bringing practical solutions, education, and encouragement to those who need it most.</p>\n\n<h2>Household Support Fund</h2>\n\n<p>Funded by the Department for Work and Pensions on behalf of the UK government, the Household Support Fund scheme supports vulnerable Kent households in need of help with significantly rising living costs. Each district council in Kent has been allocated funding under the Household Support Fund. Here in Dartford, our Delivery Plan for our allocation of the Household Support Fund seeks to help with Food Insecurity through initiatives such as Dartford Larder, Foodbanks, Energy Efficiency initiatives, and later in Phase 2 during the winter, by supporting Warm Hubs</p>\n\n<p>Dartford residents are also eligible to apply directly to KCC\u2019s application-based scheme which opened on June 24th. The summer food voucher scheme, worth \u00a390 to eligible households, will stay open until the end of August (the scheme may close earlier if all available funds are allocated). You can either refer yourself to the scheme or refer someone as a professional. The summer scheme will only offer support with food. A winter scheme will follow later in the year offering a choice between energy and food, or a combination of both energy and food support.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure-and-community/cost-of-living-support/urgent-financial-help-and-extra-support/household-support-fund\">Household Support Fund - Kent County Council</a></p>\n\n<h2>Household Support Fund 7 Summer Food Voucher Scheme</h2>\n\n<p>Funded by the Department for Work and Pensions on behalf of the UK government, the Household Support Fund scheme supports vulnerable Kent households in need of help with significantly rising living costs.</p>\n\n<p>HSF (Household Support Fund) Round 6 has now ended, and the Government has announced in the recent budget, a further 12-month extension to the HSF, meaning the HSF funding round 7 will run from April 2025 until March 2026.</p>\n\n<p>The next HSF support scheme will be delivered from June to August and will offer an online public application route that enables individual self-referral, or professional referrals on behalf of individuals, to be made.</p>\n\n<p>The summer scheme will offer food voucher only support, to the value of <strong>\u00a390</strong>, a winter scheme will follow later in the year and applicants will then have the additional option to choose between energy, food, or a combination of both energy and food support.</p>\n\n<p>The Summer Food support scheme is open for applications and will close at 12pm on Tuesday, August 26.

Kent Energy Deal was a partnership between several Kent Councils and IChoosr to help residents save money on their energy bills by using combined buying power to access highly competitive tariffs. Kent Energy Deal helped many people living in the Dartford Borough and other partner Kent Local Authorities who also ran the scheme to switch to a better tariff therefore saving money on their resident\u2019s utility bills and frequently the tariff offered was a renewable electricity tariff too. The scheme was just one of the many offered to help residents and support the Council in its carbon reduction ambitions. </p>\n\n<p>Due to the Energy crisis and the Price Caps the switching market in its entirety has been at a standstill, however IChoosr have continued to monitor the situation and talked with suppliers to stay aware of any price/market changes.</p>\n\n<p>IChoosr now believe the time is right to offer the option of the Big Community Switch again and are offering the opportunity for residents to register on line to help residents save money on their energy bills by using combined buying power to access highly competitive tariffs. This means residents can benefit from the bargaining power of a large group.</p>\n\n<p>Dartford Borough Council has formed a partnership with IChoosr to offer this service \u2013 participation is completely free with no obligation to switch. </p>\n\n<p>You can register today through the <a href=\"http://www.bigcommunityswitch.co.uk/dartford\">Big Community Switch's Dartford webpage</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Housing costs</strong></h2>\n\n<p>If you are a Council tenant, a tenant in the private sector or you have a mortgage, it\u2019s important that you talk to your landlord or lender at the earliest opportunity if you think you will have difficulty paying your rent or mortgage.</p>\n\n<p>You may be entitled to the following to help you with your housing costs:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Discretionary Housing Payments</strong></p>\n\n<p>Discretionary Housing Payments apply to both Council and private sector tenants.
