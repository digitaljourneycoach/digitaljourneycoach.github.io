PROPOSAL FOR INSTALLATION OF A BENCH AT BUS STATION (52/53 SERVICE TO WITTERINGS)</h3>\n\n<p>Cllrs considered the request for a bench at the Bus Station from residents in Stockbridge Road.

She highlighted that most of our drinking water comes from chalk aquifers, which also feed rivers like the Lavant&mdash;making water conservation critical.</p>\n\n<p>Key concerns include reducing chemical use, keep pets treated with insecticides away from open water areas to prevent chemical contamination, and promoting water butts over hosepipes. Louise emphasised the need for better water quality monitoring, noting high phosphate and nitrate levels in the Lavant due to sewage infiltration. The Trust monitors various indicators including turbidity, temperature, and biodiversity.</p>\n\n<p>They offer support for flood prevention, waste management in public buildings, and access to Operation Watershed funding. A litter pick and a tour of the Fordwater Wastewater Treatment Works are upcoming. The Trust&rsquo;s work complements the under-resourced Environment Agency, helping build a community of change.</p>\n\n<h3>24.

Plans also include installing solar panels on the flat roof to boost sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>All green infrastructure&mdash;roofs and walls&mdash;will feature built-in irrigation systems, maintained by the building&rsquo;s management company.</p>\n\n<p>The committee welcomed the updates but agreed to <strong>DEFER </strong>any decisions until the revised plans are formally submitted.</p>\n\n<p>CC/25/01355/FUL &ndash; The Atrium Southern Gate Chichester West Sussex </p>\n\n<p>Chichester City Council has <strong>NO OBJECTION</strong> to this application.</p>\n\n<p>CC/25/01408/FUL &ndash; Land South of Chichester Enterprise Centre Terminus Road Chichester West Sussex</p>\n\n<p>Chichester City Council has <strong>NO OBJECTION</strong> to this application.</p>\n\n<h3>27.
