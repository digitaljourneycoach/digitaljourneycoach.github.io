A form for reporting a missed bin/recycling collection;\n3. Footer section that mentions the copyright text;\n4. Hidden input fields for ASP.NET application state values.\n\nThe HTML also includes CSS styles and various links to other resources such as fonts, javascript libraries, and iFrames. However, without context, it is hard to determine the purpose of some elements in the code.\n\nSince the primary focus of this prompt was on generating a report, here's a summary of the information regarding reporting missed bin/recycling collections:\n- Users should contact the council if their waste/recycling was at its collection point at the correct time but was not collected;\n- The form to report a missed purple lidded bin collection is located on the page and can be found within an iFrame (though it is commented out in this provided HTML code);\n- Additional waste, which cannot fit inside the purple lidded bin, will not be collected if the reported form shows a missed collection;\n- Users are advised to retain the waste and put it back out on the next collection day if an investigation by the Waste Department is needed;\n- The page includes some helpful recommendations for users regarding the contact form loading based on their cookie preferences.",
