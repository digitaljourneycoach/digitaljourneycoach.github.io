Here's a brief summary of the page's content:\n\n1. The user starts by checking if they need planning permission for their proposed development. Tips and guidance are provided to help in this process.\n2. If planning permission is required, the next step is to check local planning policies and constraints. This includes checking whether the property falls within a conservation area, listed building, or Tree Preservation Order (TPO) area.\n3. Users can apply for pre-application advice before submitting their planning application to help in understanding the process better and ensuring that all required information and documentation is provided.\n4. After receiving pre-application advice, users should submit their planning application, along with the necessary documents, plans, and fees.\n5. The local planning authority makes a decision on each planning application based on various factors such as policies, local plans, community impact, etc. Users can check the progress of their applications online.\n6. If the planning application is granted, users can start working on their project. If the application is refused, the user has the option to appeal the decision. If amendments need to be made to a granted application, users can make these changes with relevant procedures and fees.\n7. Developer contributions towards infrastructure and new services may also apply depending on the size and nature of the development project.",
