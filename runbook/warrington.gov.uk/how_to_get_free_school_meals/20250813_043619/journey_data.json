The page provides information about the eligibility for free school meals and how to apply for them.\n\nHere's a brief summary of what the page contains:\n\n1. Eligibility for free school meals is based on families receiving certain benefits or having an annual income that does not exceed \u00a316,190.\n2. Parents can check their eligibility and apply for free school meals through Warrington Borough Council's website.\n3. The application process involves providing proof of their entitlement to specific benefits or income.\n4. If eligible, the child will receive a universal meal (as opposed to the usual school dinner charge) and may also be entitled to additional support.\n5. There is also a Household Support Fund available for residents in three specific sectors: parents with children, those on the lowest incomes, and pensioners within the community.\n\nThe page includes buttons for navigating to other related pages such as schools homepage, moving schools, primary and secondary school admissions, school admission appeals, and an application form for free school meals for families with no recourse to public funds.",
