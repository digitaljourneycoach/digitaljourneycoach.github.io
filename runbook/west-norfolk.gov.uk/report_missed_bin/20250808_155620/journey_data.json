While I cannot interact with the actual webpage itself as I am just a text-based AI, I can offer information based on understanding this HTML code.\n\nIf you ever encounter a problem with your waste collection in West Norfolk, you can go to this website and click on \"Report missed bin\" under the section \"Missed bin collections.\" You will be directed to a form where you can provide your details, choose the type of bin that was missed, its location, and the date it should have been emptied. After filling out the form, simply hit the \"Send feedback\" button to submit your request for assistance.\n\nAside from reporting missed bin collections, this page also offers links to various related topics such as recycling sacks ordering, red tags information, small electrical item collections, and used household battery collections. You can find these linked topics within the \"Related pages\" section of the sidebar.",
