This page includes information on eligibility, how to apply, and provision during school holidays. It also explains the upcoming changes regarding automatic checks and how families can opt-out if they wish. Additionally, there's related content and a feedback form link available.\n\nHere is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. Free school meals are provided for eligible children to ensure they have nutritious meals during school days, reducing hunger and helping them perform better academically.\n2. Eligibility is based on the following criteria: income support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, child tax credit (with an annual income of less than \u00a316,190, as assessed by HMRC), guaranteed element of State Pension Credit, or those who have an annual salary less than \u00a37,400.\n3. Families can apply for free school meals online or via a hard-copy application form. The process is quick and straightforward.\n4. Schools will provide the necessary forms to complete for qualifying students. Parents/guardians must provide proof of their eligibility before an application can be processed.\n5. Starting April 2025, automatic eligibility checks will be conducted annually during the summer holidays for continuation in the free school meals program.\n6. Families who do not wish to opt-in for future automatic checks may do so by following the provided link and filling out an opt-out form.\n7. Eligible families can also request a check if they move into Bedford Borough, experience a change in circumstances, or believe their child might be eligible but haven't received communication from authorities.\n8. The website includes related content such as free school meals provision during school holidays and a feedback form link to rate the webpage.",
