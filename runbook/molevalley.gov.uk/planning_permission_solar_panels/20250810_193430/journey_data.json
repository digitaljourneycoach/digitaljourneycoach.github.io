                        "content": " Here is a summary of the information provided on the website you have linked, regarding building and home extensions in Mole Valley, Surrey:\n\n1. **Planning Permission**: Most alterations to houses and buildings need planning permission, including shop and office extensions, alterations to shopfronts, and external security shutters or grilles. Commercial buildings also generally require planning permission for alterations such as shop and office extensions.\n\n2. **Permitted Development Rights (PD)**: PD rights allow most householders to build single-storey rear extensions that do not extend beyond the rear wall of the original house by more than four metres if a detached house, or more than three metres for any other house. However, in some circumstances, under the \"larger\" home extension legislation, this limit is increased to:\n   - Eight metres for detached houses\n   - Six metres for all other houses\n\n3. **Larger Home Extensions**: If you wish to build a \"larger\" home extension under PD, you must notify the local planning authority using the appropriate application form. They will decide if it complies with the regulations within eight weeks. This does not apply where permitted development rights have been removed, or if the property is located within a Conservation Area, National Landscape (AONB), or is a Listed Building.\n\n4. **Domestic solar panels**: The installation of solar panels and equipment on residential buildings and land may be PD with no need to apply for planning permission. However, there are important limits and conditions which must be met to benefit from these permitted development rights. Details can be found on the Planning Portal website.\n\n5. **Lawful Development Certificates (LDC)**: If you are in doubt about the need to obtain planning permission for the proposed work or you need formal confirmation, you should submit a Certificate of Lawfulness for Proposed Development with accompanying plans. This will allow a planning officer to confirm whether you will require planning permission. There may be a fee associated with this process.\n\n6. **Choosing an architect**: Anyone who calls themselves an architect must be trained, qualified, and registered with the Architects Registration Board (ARB). To help you choose, it is suggested that you talk to other people who have employed the services of an architect or look in directories of trade professionals. The ARB has a register of qualified architects that can be accessed on their website.\n\n7. **Land ownership and boundaries**: The Land Registry registers title to land and records dealings with registered land. For more information about boundary, rights of way, access, or land ownership issues, please contact Surrey County Council at 03456 009 009 or visit their website.\n\n8. **New development in the green belt**: Development of new dwellings within the green belt is contrary to national and local planning policies and will not be granted planning permission.\n\n9. **Applying for a vehicle crossover or dropped kerb**: Surrey County Council Highways owns most roads and footpaths in Mole Valley. It is an offence to carry out any works to the footway without their permission. More information can be found on the Surrey County Council website. The process involves completing an enquiry form (fees apply from 1 April 2025) and obtaining approval from Surrey County Council once you have the necessary letter or permission from the local planning authority.\n\nThe website also provides contact details for the local planning authority, Surrey County Council, and the Architects Registration Board, as well as various other relevant bodies and resources.",
