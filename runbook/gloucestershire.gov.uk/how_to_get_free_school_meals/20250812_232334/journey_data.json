Please only apply here if your child does not have entitlement already. If your child attends an independent school, you will need to apply direct to the school.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Apply online</h2>\n<p>If you have applied online for a school admission place or 2-year-old funding previously, please use the same login details.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://emsonline.gloucestershire.gov.uk/CitizenPortal/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fCitizenPortal\" target=\"_blank\" data-anchor=\"?ReturnUrl=%2fCitizenPortal\"><strong>Apply for free school meals</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Please note -</strong> If your child attends one of the following schools, you will need to contact them directly regarding free school meals. These schools have opted out of our free school meal assessments service:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Barnwood Park School</li>\n    <li>Bourton on the Water Primary School</li>\n    <li>Five Acres High School</li>\n    <li>Gloucester Academy School</li>\n    <li>Grange Primary School</li>\n    <li>Holmleigh Park High School</li>\n    <li>Henley Bank High School</li>\n    <li>Hunts Grove Primary Academy</li>\n    <li>Moat Primary Academy</li>\n    <li>The Ridge School</li>\n    <li>Robinswood Primary Academy</li>\n    <li>Waterwells Primary Academy</li>\n    <li>Widden Primary School</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Why should I apply?</h3>\n<p>For every child that is entitled to free school meals the school receives extra funding to enhance provision and improve progress and outcomes for children. So please apply even if you do not wish to take up your free school meal.</p>\n\n<h3>What are the qualifying criteria for Free School Meals?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Your child might be able to get free school meals if you get any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Universal Credit (provided you have an annual net earned income of no more than &pound;7,400 per year / &pound;616 per month, as assessed by earnings from up to 3 of your most recent assessment periods)</li>\n    <li>Income Support</li>\n    <li>Income-based Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance</li>\n    <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>\n    <li>Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>\n    <li>The guaranteed element of Pension Credit</li>\n    <li>Child Tax Credit (provided you are not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than &pound;16,190)</li>\n    <li>Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Children who get paid these benefits directly, instead of through a parent or guardian, can also get free school meals.</p>\n\n<h3>Infant free school meals in England</h3>\n<p>Your child will be able to get free school meals if they are in:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Reception</li>\n    <li>Year 1</li>\n    <li>Year 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We still ask that you apply for free school meals to prevent your child's school missing out on additional funding.</p>\n\n<h3>How long will it take to get a response?</h3>\n<p>You will receive an instant response once you have submitted your claim. All you need is your National Insurance Number and a current email address.</p>\n<p>When your application is received, your eligibility will be checked with the Department for Education, the Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Home Office. If unsuccessful, children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 will still receive universal infant free school meals.</p>\n\n<h3>Transferring to secondary school</h3>\n<p>If your child is currently receiving free school meals at their primary school and transferring to secondary school in September, you do not need to reapply. We will reassess your eligibility in July and if there has been a change in your financial circumstances, meaning your child is no longer entitled to free school meals, we will contact you to confirm.</p>\n\n<h3>Free school meals for over 16s</h3>\n<p>All 16 - 18 year old learners who are, or whose parents are, in receipt of eligible benefits and enrolled in further education provision funded via the Education Funding Agency can apply for free school meals.</p>\n<p>Learners who are aged 19 - 25 who have a Learning Difficulty Assessment (LDA) or an Education Health and Care Plan (EHC Plan) are also entitled to free meals under this scheme.</p>\n<p>All eligible 16 - 18 year old learners who attend a Sixth Form at a school/academy can apply using the free school meals link above. For all 16 - 18 year old learners who attend other colleges/institutions, please contact them for more information on how to apply.</p>\n\n<h3>Transitional Protection</h3>\n<p>Transitional protection was initially in place between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2025, meaning pupils who became eligible for free school meals during or before this period continued to receive them until the end of their current phase of education (i.e. primary or secondary), even if there was a change in household circumstances. This has now been extended until the end of the 2025/26 school year.</p>\n<p>In addition, all pupils who become eligible for free school meals under the benefits-based criteria during this time, will receive free meals until the end of the 2025/26 school year.</p>\n<p>Eligibility will remain in place until the end of the 2025/26 school year regardless of any change in household circumstances, including an increase in earnings above the eligibility threshold, or phase of education.</p>\n<p>From the start of the 2026/27 academic year, it is the Department for Education&rsquo;s intention that all protections will be discontinued, alongside an extension to the eligibility criteria for free school meals. From September 2026 families must meet the eligibility criteria to be entitled to free school meals.</p>\n<p>For more information, including eligibility criteria, please see the Frequently Asked Questions below.</p>\n\n<h3>Contact us</h3>\n<p>If you have not managed to find an answer to your question in the information above, contact us on 01452 425390 or <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"mailto:freeschoolmeals@gloucestershire.gov.uk\" target=\"_blank\">freeschoolmeals@gloucestershire.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n```",
