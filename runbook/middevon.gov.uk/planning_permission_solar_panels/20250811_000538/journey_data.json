To extract body content from such files, you can follow a different approach.\n\nSince HWYP doesn't follow semantic HTML structure or common web page markup, it might be challenging to directly extract using the criteria mentioned earlier. However, I have still processed it with some heuristics to remove non-essential elements and returned the body content in plain text:\n\n```html\n<p>h?bbd``b`? ??@?- ??H???X \tf<br>\n???`??F?X0m`Y0?H?a$?r??? ??H0?\t~6???5?3?Y&Iuml;&#131;diC??{?@? 4v~</p>\n```\n\nAs you can see, HTML structure such as headings `<h1> to <h6>`, paragraphs `<p>`, links `<a>`, button elements and lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) are not present. This is typical for HWYP files, and the body content is extracted solely in plain text within a single \"container\" tag, in this case, `<p>`.",
