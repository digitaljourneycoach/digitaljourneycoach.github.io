The deadline to register for Solar Together closed on 25 April 2025. The deadline for accepting offers was 16 May 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Do you want to save on your energy bill and generate your own clean electricity? Having your own solar panels can be a smart investment.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve been working with the <a href=\"http://www.hccsp.org.uk/\">Hertfordshire Climate Change and Sustainability Partnership</a> (HCCSP) to launch Solar Together across Hertfordshire. Solar Together is a solar group-buy scheme run by iChoosr in conjunction with local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in North Herts, or run a business, organisation, or community group here, you can register your interest in solar panels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://solartogether.co.uk/north-hertfordshire/home\">Solar Together</a> scheme aims to offer installation of solar panels (and battery storage if wanted) at a competitive price. It works by grouping together people from across the county who are interested in generating their own renewable energy, and then acting as an intermediary for them to increase their bargaining power.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s free to register your interest and you are under no obligation to proceed if the price and recommendation do not meet your expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Solar Together pre-vets all their installers to ensure you\u2019ll receive a high-quality service from a certified provider, and you will only receive a singular recommendation from an installer, so you won\u2019t be inundated with numerous offers.</p>\n\n<p>Each offer consists of a complete system, including a survey, installation, monitoring and warranties.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-solar-together\">Benefits of Solar Together</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Competitive prices</strong> - collective bargaining power to give below-market prices for individual customers</li>\n  <li><strong>Hassle-free personal recommendation</strong> - you will receive a personal recommendation to make a decision on, which means no need to get multiple quotes or compare offers</li>\n  <li><strong>Trusted installers and insurance-backed guarantees</strong> - pre-vetted installers, the opportunity to meet the winning installer, and offers with protected guarantees</li>\n  <li><strong>Save money</strong> - with increased energy costs you can save money on your bills by generating your own renewable energy</li>\n  <li><strong>Become greener</strong> - we want North Herts to be carbon neutral by 2040, but a significant portion of our district\u2019s emissions currently come from domestic energy usage. Solar panels will allow you to generate your own renewable energy and reduce your impact on the environment so we can all live in a cleaner and greener district.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-register\">How to register</h2>\n\n<p>Registration has now closed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"recommendation\">Your personal recommendation</h2>\n\n<p>If you registered your interest, you should have received your offer after 23 March. The deadline for accepting offers was 16 May.</p>\n\n<p>All installations are planned to be complete six months after the point of acceptance, though there may be some delays due to supply chain issues.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, contact <a href=\"https://www.solartogether.co.uk/\">Solar Together</a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:hertfordshire@solartogether.co.uk\">hertfordshire@solartogether.co.uk</a></li>\n  <li>Call: 0800 285 1347 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"do-i-need-planning-permission\">Do I need planning permission?</h3>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, planning permission isn\u2019t needed for the installation of solar panels (or internal battery storage) as they are considered a \u2018permitted development\u2019. There are a few caveats to this, but all Solar Together installers are MCS accredited and can design your system in line with these requirements. More information on permissions needed can be found on our <a href=\"/solar-panels-and-wind-turbine-guidance\" data-type=\"basic_page\" data-id=\"1480\">planning web pages here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The document <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/permitted-development-rights-for-householders-technical-guidance\">Technical Guidance \u2013 Permitted Rights for householders</a> is also available on GOV.UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"do-i-need-any-other-permissions\">Do I need any other permissions?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Listed buildings:</strong> If you live in a listed building, you will need to contact our planning department to apply for Listed Building Consent from the council. You can find out more information about listed building consent from <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/lbc/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20alter,from%20your%20local%20planning%20authority.\">Historic England</a> and on the Planning Portal: <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/planning/planning-applications/consent-types/listed-building-consent\">Listed building consent - Consent types - Planning Portal</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Conservation areas:</strong> If you live within a Conservation Area the installation of solar panels may also benefit from \u2018permitted development\u2019 rights, however you are advised to get in contact with our planning department who can advise on the specific criteria relevant to the installation of solar panels in conservation areas. Contact information can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/do-i-need-planning-permission#:~:text=The%20Duty%20Officer%20service%20provides,Friday%20%2D%20call%20on%2001462%20474000.\">Do I need planning permission? | North Herts Council (north-herts.gov.uk)</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Letchworth Garden City:</strong> If you live in Letchworth, you will need to obtain the permission of the Letchworth Heritage Foundation before any external changes can be made to your property, and your solar panelling will need to comply with the Foundation\u2019s design principles which can be found at the follow links:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.letchworth.com/sites/default/files/documents/2019-07/let_7392_heritage_character_brochure_june2019_v8_0_0.pdf\">Heritage Character Area Design Principles</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.letchworth.com/sites/default/files/documents/2017-09/let_7391_modern_character_brochure_june2015_v8.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.letchworth.com/sites/default/files/documents/2017-09/let_7391_modern_character_brochure_june2015_v8.pdf\">Modern Character Area Design Principles</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.letchworth.com/sites/default/files/documents/2017-09/let_7391_modern_character_brochure_june2015_v8.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.letchworth.com/sites/default/files/documents/2017-09/let_7391_modern_character_brochure_june2015_v8.pdf\">New Housing Development Design Principles</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To apply for permission, please use the Heritage Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"https://portal.letchworth.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://portal.letchworth.com/\">Application Portal.</a></p>\n\n<p>You can find more information and pre-application advice here: <a href=\"https://www.letchworth.com/your-home\">Letchworth Garden City Heritage Foundation</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Restrictive Covenants:</strong> There may be additional permissions known as restrictive covenants on some properties, which require the owner to gain consent from the Covenantee in order to make any alterations or additions to the property. Restrictive covenants may have been added by the original developers, property management companies, or other parties, and are often found on ex-social housing properties. It is worth checking your Title Deeds to see if this is the case for you and from who you need to seek consent if so.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-i-participate-if-i-dont-own-the-building-or-if-i-live-in-a-flat\">Can I participate if I don\u2019t own the building or if I live in a flat?</h3>\n\n<p>If you live in a flat, you need to be one of the owners of the roof (or the sole owner), or obtain written permission from the landlord and the other residents. Where the freehold is shared, you will require permission from all owners of the roof. You will also need to have your own consumer unit for your flat and it will be your responsibility to maintain the panels unless otherwise agreed with the landlord or building owners.</p>\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t own the home or building that you\u2019d like to have solar installed on, you will need to obtain written permission from your landlord.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"will-i-be-able-to-use-stored-energy-during-a-power-blackout\">Will I be able to use stored energy during a power blackout?</h3>\n\n<p>It is possible to have an Emergency Power Supply (EPS) attached to a solar battery which allows you to use electricity stored during a blackout. Customers who are interested in this option can speak to their installer about having an EPS installed if they would like to be able to use their stored power in a blackout. This option is only possible if the customer has solar battery storage.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"more-information\">More information</h2>\n\n<p>Solar Together is the only solar scheme currently supported by North Herts Council.
