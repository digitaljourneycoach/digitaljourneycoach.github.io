The first section asks the user if they are providing feedback on the council service (good or bad) and, if bad, if it's related to the website or not.\n\n2. Depending on the answer provided in step 1, different sets of radio buttons appear for the user to select the specific reason for their good or bad experience.\n\n3. After selecting the reasons, there is an optional textarea for more detailed feedback where users can express their thoughts and concerns about the council service or website.\n\n4. Finally, there is a submit button at the bottom for users to submit their feedback.\n\nOverall, this form seems designed to help organizations gather user feedback on their services, making it easier to identify issues and improve their offerings based on actual user experience.",
