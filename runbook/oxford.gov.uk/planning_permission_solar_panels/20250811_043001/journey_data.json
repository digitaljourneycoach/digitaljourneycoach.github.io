If your house is in a conservation area you may require planning permission to carry out alterations or add elements to the building but in many conservation areas changes are possible without permission.</p>\n<p>If either applies, please read our <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/making-planning-application/pre-application-planning-advice\">Pre-application planning advice page</a>. More detail on determining the historic impact of your home can be found by downloading <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/file/1603/heet-step-1-understanding-your-historic-building\">Understanding your historic building guidance</a> (PDF, 1.6MB).</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/download/418/download-the-heritage-energy-efficiency-tool-heet\">Heritage Energy Efficiency Tool</a> can be used to work through useful and more detailed steps for improving energy efficiency in your property. Whilst our checklist is relevant for older buildings, we advise that you seek further information as the situation is more complicated.</p>\n<p>There is more information about what developments (including solar panels and other renewable energy installations) are permitted development (ie not requiring planning permission) on the <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200125/do_you_need_permission/90/interactive_house\">Planning Portal\u2019s interactive house</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2 - Simple measures</h2>\n<p>There are often a number of simple measures that you will be able to carry out that will give a quick and relatively economic result before resorting to the more intrusive and expensive energy efficiency options which are likely to have a longer period of payback.</p>\n<p>It is useful to prioritise the simple measures you can do in your home. Use the checklist below to see how many of the basics energy efficiency measures you have completed. Please ensure that appropriate ventilation is in place - e.g. mechanical extract fan in wet rooms.</p>\n<p>Please also check our <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/download/419/download-building-regulations-advice-for-energy-efficiency-works-in-historic-homes\">Building Regulations guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>Ensure that the building has adequate ventilation to prevent a build-up of damp which can lead to fabric decay and ultimately to loss of building fabric.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3 - Medium impact measures</h2>\n<p>The measures below cost a little more but will make more of an impact. Please seek advice if you have a Listed building or live in a conservation area.</p>\n<p>Please also check our <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/download/419/download-building-regulations-advice-for-energy-efficiency-works-in-historic-homes\">Building Regulations guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 4 - Higher impact/intrusive insulation</h2>\n<p>When all other options have been considered or completed and the property remains difficult to heat, external wall insulation may be possible in properties that are not listed or in conservation areas. Most buildings in a conservation area are not restricted for internal alterations buildings.</p>\n<p>You can find out more by downloading our <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/download/418/download-the-heritage-energy-efficiency-tool-heet\">Heritage Energy Efficiency Tool</a>. Please also check our <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/downloads/download/419/download-building-regulations-advice-for-energy-efficiency-works-in-historic-homes\">Building Regulations guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Please use this checklist when talking to Planning officers about any potential external or internal wall insulation for your property. They will be reassured that you have carefully considered the different smaller energy efficiency measures for your building before requesting these installations. <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/making-planning-application/pre-application-planning-advice\">Read our pre-application planning advice page</a> for more details.</p>\n\n<p>*This is usually not possible in listed buildings because it has a substantially harmful impact on the building fabric and the size and proportion of rooms.</p>\n```",
