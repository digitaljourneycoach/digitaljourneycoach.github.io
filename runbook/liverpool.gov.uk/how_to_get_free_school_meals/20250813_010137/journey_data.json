The page also includes some additional resources and a live chat feature.\n\nAt the top of the page, there are navigation links for other sections of the website. Below that, there is a section called \"Is my child eligible for free school meals?\" with bullet points about children in different age groups and whether they are automatically eligible or need to apply.\n\n below that, there is a section called \"What are the qualifying benefits?\" which explains what benefits justify an application for free school meals. After that, there is a section called \"Before you apply\" that instructs applicants to have their National Insurance number or National Asylum Support Service (NASS) number handy, as these will be used to confirm eligibility with the Department of Work and Pensions.\n\nThere's a section called \"How to apply\" that explains how to apply online via the Citizen Portal using either an existing account or registering for a new one. The following sections provide information about what happens after the application is submitted, including the time period during which children will continue to receive free school meals regardless of changes in income, and what the Pupil Premium funding is used for.\n\nThe page also includes some additional sections such as a tip box about foster parents, a note on applying for further education students who do not attend school sixth form, links to the privacy notice, and footer section. At the bottom of the page there is a live chat feature which can be used to get in touch with someone for help with the application process.",
