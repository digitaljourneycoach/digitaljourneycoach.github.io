You can report a missed refuse collection online after 5 PM on the same day the collection was due to take place or by phone from 8:30 AM to 3 PM on the next working day (Monday to Friday) after your collection should have taken place.\n\nHowever, I'd like to remind you that I am an AI model and do not collect data or provide support for specific websites like Denbighshire. If you want to report a missed refuse collection according to the given information, just follow the instructions on their webpage.
