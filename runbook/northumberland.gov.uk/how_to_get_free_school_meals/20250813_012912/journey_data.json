We ensure that all children attending council-managed schools within Northumberland have access to healthy meals, which are made using as much local produce as possible.</p>\n<p>We produce menus that follow the food standards provided by the government. Some schools do choose to manage their own catering services. If this applies to your school, please speak to your school cook about their menus.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dietary-requirements\">Dietary requirements</h2>\n<p>We cater for a variety of special diets, including dairy-free, coeliac, and lactose-free diets. If your child has any dietary requirements, please contact their school cook directly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"free-school-meals\">Free school meals</h2>\n<p>How free school meals work, and for information on how to apply for free school meals.</p>\n\n<h3>Universal free school meals</h3>\n<p>All pupils in reception, year one, and year two are entitled to a free meal, without having to apply for this option. However, if you feel you may be eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) it is important that you apply immediately as FSM eligibility means other resources may be available to the school and your child including pupil premium. Please consider an eligibility check for FSM when applying to a School, please do not wait until your child is in year 3.</p>\n<p>Eligibility for free school meals The government has made amendments to the eligibility criteria since April 2018. This is to reflect the introduction of Universal Credit. &#8239;Free school meals are available to pupils in receipt of, or whose parents are in receipt of, one or more of the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Universal Credit</li>\n    <li>Provided you have an annual net income of no more than &pound;7,400</li>\n    <li>This is assessed by earnings from up to three of your most recent assessment periods</li>\n    <li>Income Support</li>\n    <li>Income-based Job Seekers Allowance</li>\n    <li>Income related Employment and Support Allowance</li>\n    <li>Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>\n    <li>The guarantee element of Pension Credit</li>\n    <li>Child Tax Credit</li>\n    <li>Provided you are not entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than &pound;16,190</li>\n    <li>Working Tax Credit run on</li>\n    <li>Paid four weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, if you feel you may be eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) it is important that you apply immediately as FSM eligibility means other resources may be available to the school and your child including pupil premium. Please consider an eligibility check for FSM when applying to a School, please do not wait until your child is in year 3.</p>\n\n<h3>What do the changes to free school meals mean?</h3>\n<p>Most people won't be affected by the new criteria. If you're currently claiming free school meals, but don't meet the new criteria, your child will continue to receive free school meals until the end of the Universal Credit roll-out period.&#8239; The roll-out period isn't scheduled to end until March 2025. Once Universal Credit is fully rolled out, your child will keep their free school meals entitlement until the end of their current phase of education, i.e primary to secondary.</p>\n\n<h3>Apply for free school meals</h3>\n<p>Online:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://schadm.northumberland.gov.uk/CitizenPortal_LIVE/\">Free school meals application form</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.northumberland.gov.uk/NorthumberlandCountyCouncil/media/Document-store/School%20Meals/PN-25-01-Free-School-Meals.pdf\">Free School Meals Privacy Policy</a></p>\n<p>Telephone:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"tel:0345%20600%206400\">0345 600 6400</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"revenues-and-benefits\">Revenues and Benefits</h2>\n<p>Benefit details for applications can be checked on receipt.
