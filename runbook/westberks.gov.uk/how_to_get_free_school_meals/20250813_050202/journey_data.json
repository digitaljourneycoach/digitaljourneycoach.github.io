If you are in receipt of the above, your child will also qualify for pupil premium support so it is important for you to apply. Please see below for more information about pupil premium.</p><h4><strong>Applying for free school meals</strong></h4><p>To apply for free school meals at West Berkshire schools and maintained nurseries you can:</p><ul><li><strong><a class=\"a-body__link\" href=\"https://www.westberks.gov.uk/free-school-meals-apply\">Apply online</a></strong>. It's quick and easy and you can do this at a time that is convenient for you - we'll contact you by email to confirm if you qualify <br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong><a class=\"a-body__link\" href=\"https://www.westberks.gov.uk/contact-free-school-meals-team\">Apply over the phone</a></strong>. We'll take you through the form for you right there and then, just have your National Insurance number ready <br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h4><strong>Pupil Premium</strong></h4><p>Pupil Premium is extra government funding that is paid to schools for every child who's eligible for free school meals throughout their time at school. It can help to pay for important things, like school trips, uniforms and PE kit, music lessons, and additional help with subjects like English and Maths. Schools are required to have a pupil premium policy on their website that explains how the funds will be used.</p><p>Getting the right information to make sure that Pupil Premium money can be claimed for your child is sometimes complicated for schools.</p><p>If your child qualifies for free school meals, or has at any point in the past six years, it's important that you tell their school so they can get the extra funding.</p><p>This applies even if your child is:</p><ul><li>In reception, year 1 or year 2</li><li>in a year group other than reception, year 1 or year 2 and there are fewer than six pupils in that year group who are eligible for free school meals (this is known as a small class size)</li></ul>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</main>\n```",
