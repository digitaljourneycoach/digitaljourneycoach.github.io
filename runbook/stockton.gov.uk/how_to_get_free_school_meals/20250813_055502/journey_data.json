Here is a general idea of how the analysis process would look:\n\n1. Remove any non-essential child elements from `main-content`, such as headings (<h1>-<h6>), paragraphs (<p>), links (<a>) and button elements, lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>), and blockquotes (<blockquote>) if they are part of the main content.\n2. Further parse these kept essential elements for their own child content and repeat the analysis process recursively until only the central editorial content remains.\n3. Finally, after analyzing all the child elements and removing any non-essential decorative or boilerplate elements (e.g., site-wide search, login links, social media footers), the cleaned semantically structured HTML containing the main body content would be returned.",
