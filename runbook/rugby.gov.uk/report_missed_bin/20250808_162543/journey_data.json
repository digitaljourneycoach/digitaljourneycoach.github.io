In this case, it houses several portlets (a component from a web application framework) dealing with web content, reviews, and cookie consent.\n\n3. Portlets: These are modules within the web page that can function independently with their own interface, data source, and processing logic. In the given code, there are two portlets - \"WebContentReviewPortlet\" and \"CookieConsentPortlet.\"\n\n4. `<section>`: Divides the content into distinct sections, making it easier to style and manipulate using CSS. Each section in this example has an individual CSS class for styling purposes.\n\n5.
