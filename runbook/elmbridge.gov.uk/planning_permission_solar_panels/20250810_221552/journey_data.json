There's also information about the local government district and a search box for quick navigation.\n\nThe main content is an article providing guidance on whether a project needs planning permission, explaining how to use the Planning Portal's interactive house and common projects guides provided by the Planning Portal. It further discusses lawful development certificates, permitted development, prior approval, and other permissions that may be required like listed buildings consent, changes in conservation areas, affecting protected trees, getting the kerb lowered outside your property, etc.\n\nFinally, the footer contains a feedback form linking to an external page where users can provide suggestions to help improve the site.
