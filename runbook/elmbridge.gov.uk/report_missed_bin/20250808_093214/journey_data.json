Bins won't be collected if they're not out on the right collection day, contain non-acceptable items, are too heavy, or have open lids.\n3. The crew won't collect any recycling placed in black bags.\n4. For missed garden waste collection, you should check the terms and conditions, as the service might not be active on your collection day.\n5.
