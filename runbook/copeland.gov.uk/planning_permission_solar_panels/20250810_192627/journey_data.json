The first website ([www.copeland.gov.uk](http://www.copeland.gov.uk)) is the official website of Copeland Borough Council, a local government authority in Cumbria, England. The homepage provides information about various services and departments offered by the council, as well as news and events updates. It also offers options for paying bills, requesting services, reporting issues, and finding job opportunities within the council.\n\n2. The second website ([www.copeland.gov.uk/info/200614/planning\\_and\\_building\\_control](http://www.copeland.gov.uk/info/200614/planning_and_building_control)) is a specific page within the Copeland Borough Council website that focuses on planning and building control services. This includes information about planning applications, building regulations, conservation areas, listed buildings, and enforcement action.\n\n3. The third website ([copelandcommunityfund.co.uk](http://copelandcommunityfund.co.uk)) is the website for the Copeland Community Fund, which provides funding for community projects in the Copeland area. The website provides information about how to apply for funding, guidelines, and examples of funded projects.\n\n4. The fourth website ([www.thebeacon-whitehaven.co.uk](http://www.thebeacon-whitehaven.co.uk)) is the website for the Beacon Museum in Whitehaven, Cumbria. The museum features exhibits related to the local area's history and culture. The website provides information about admission prices, opening times, temporary exhibitions, educational resources, membership benefits, and a shop selling museum-related merchandise.\n\n5.

The sixth website ([www.wellwhitehaven.org](http://www.wellwhitehaven.org)) does not appear to be active as of now. It was a local community health and wellbeing service for Whitehaven and the surrounding areas. However, it's possible that it has been rebranded or absorbed into another service since then.\n\n7. The seventh website ([www.coolcopeland.co.uk](http://www.coolcopeland.co.uk)) is the website for Visit Cumbria, a tourism information and promotion site for Cumbria. It features information about things to do, places to stay, events, and attractions in Cumbria.
