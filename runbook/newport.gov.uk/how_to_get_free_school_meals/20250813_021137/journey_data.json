However, since there is no actual text or structure within that div in the example you've given, I'll assume that the main content might include headings, paragraphs, links, lists, and blockquotes. Here's a simplified output:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"main-content\">\n    <h1>Main Title</h1>\n    <p>This is the main body text with some information about the article.</p>\n    <a href=\"example.com\">Link to an important page or article</a>\n    <ul>\n        <li>List item 1</li>\n        <li>List item 2</li>\n    </ul>\n    <blockquote>This could be a quote from someone relevant, perhaps.</blockquote>\n</div>\n```\n\nNote that I've assumed the existence of headings, paragraphs, a link, an unordered list, and a blockquote since they are semantically significant elements for providing structure to the main body of the content. In reality, these might not actually be present in the HTML source you provided. To get accurate results, you should replace the example HTML with actual content from a web page.\n\nAdditionally, this cleansed markup still contains class attributes, which may not always be necessary but can help to preserve some level of structure and organization for better understanding or possible automated processing. However, in some cases, stripping these classes out can also produce cleaner output, depending on the specific requirements of your application.",
