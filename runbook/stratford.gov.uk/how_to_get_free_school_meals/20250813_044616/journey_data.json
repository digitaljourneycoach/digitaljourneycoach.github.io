Here are some key components of the website:\n\n1. Header: The website has a header that includes navigation menus, search bar, login options, and site information like accessibility links and contact details.\n\n2. Content: The main content section appears below the header, divided into several sections like \"Quick Links\", \"Latest News\" and \"What's On\". Each section is primarily composed of text, images, and embedded links.\n\n3. Footer: At the bottom of every page is a footer that contains copyright information, social media icons, and quick access to frequently visited pages such as sitemap and privacy policy.\n\n4. Pop-up Search Bar: A mobile-optimized search bar pops up when clicking the magnifying glass icon in the header. Users can enter keywords to search for content on the website.\n\n5. Modal Boxes: There are two modal boxes--\"Quick Links\" and \"RPI\" (Regional Property Information)--that appear when clicked on the respective icons in the header. The \"Quick Links\" box provides quick access to a list of popular pages, while the \"RPI\" box displays information related to council-owned properties.\n\n6. Footer Navigation: Users can navigate to different sections of the website using links accessible from the footer. These include pages like sitemap, privacy policy, disclaimer, and more.\n\nIn addition to these features, the website also uses JavaScript libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap.",
