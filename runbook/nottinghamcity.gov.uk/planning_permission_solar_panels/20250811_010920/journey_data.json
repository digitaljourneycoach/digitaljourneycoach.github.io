The main content of the page is structured within a `<body>` element, which contains two main components: a navbar (with links to different sections) and a container with grid layout for the page body contents.\n\nThe navbar structure consists of a container, an optional sticky top navbar for better user experience on scrolling, and additional options, classes, and scripts to customize its appearance and functionality.\n\nThe main content part has two columns (left sidebar and right content) with Bootstrap classes `col-md-3` (sidebar) and `col-md-9` (content). The left sidebar contains links to major sections on the website, such as 'Welcome', 'About', 'Planning', etc., while the right content section contains more detailed information and forms.\n\nAdditionally, there are two custom contact forms created with the 'UmbracoForms' plugin: one for contacting the council, and another to provide feedback on the website. The 'contact-form' uses a custom email delivery service and has fields for first name, last name, email address, and subject/message, along with a reCAPTCHA verification checkbox.\n\nThe other form 'plan_feedback' is used to collect user input about Planning Permission and has similar fields like first name, last name, email address, subject/message, along with checkboxes for selecting the types of buildings under consideration. The forms can be submitted only after a successful reCAPTCHA verification.\n\nFinally, at the bottom of the page, you will find links to other useful resources and a website survey for user feedback. The provided HTML code structure helps enhance the website usability and overall user experience by offering intuitive navigation and accessible contact options.",
