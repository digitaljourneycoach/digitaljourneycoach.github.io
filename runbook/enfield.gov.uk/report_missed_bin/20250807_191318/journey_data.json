However, assuming that the original HTML contains more content elements within the `<main-content>` div, I will demonstrate how to extract clean and semantically structured HTML containing the central editorial content of a page while preserving meaningful structural elements like headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`, `<button>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>, <li>`), and blockquotes.\n\nI will modify the existing HTML to include more content elements:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n<head>\n  <!-- Head section omitted for brevity -->\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"header\">Header Content</div>\n  <div class=\"navbar\">Navigation and footer links</div>\n  <div id=\"cookie-banner\" class=\"hide-for-small\">Cookie Banner</div>\n  <div class=\"side-cart-container hide-for-small\">Side Cart</div>\n\n  <div class=\"main-wrapper\" role=\"main\">\n    <!-- Main content elements -->\n    <article class=\"post\">\n      <h1>Article Title</h1>\n      <p>A paragraph containing text.</p>\n      <blockquote cite=\"https://example.com/source\">\n        Blockquoted text from the source.\n      </blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>List item 1</li>\n        <li>List item 2</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>An in-text link: <a href=\"https://example.com/link\">The link text</a></p>\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit button</button>\n    </article>\n\n    <div class=\"related-posts\">Related posts section</div>\n    <!-- Additional content elements omitted for brevity -->\n  </div>\n\n  <footer>Footer Content</footer>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe modified HTML code above illustrates the original HTML with additional content elements and sections like headers, in-text links, lists, blockquotes, etc.\n\nTo extract only the main body content, we will strip out non-essential page furniture like:\n\n1. Headers (`<div class=\"header\">`)\n2. Navigation menus (`<div class=\"navbar\">`)\n3. Cookie banners (`<div id=\"cookie-banner\" class=\"hide-for-small\">`)\n4. Sidebars (`<div class=\"side-cart-container hide-for-small\">`)\n5. Footer (`<footer>`)\n\nFinally, we will clean the `main-wrapper` and return the cleaned HTML with only meaningful structural elements and content:\n\n```html\n<article class=\"post\">\n    <h1>Article Title</h1>\n    <p>A paragraph containing text.</p>\n    <blockquote cite=\"https://example.com/source\">\n        Blockquoted text from the source.\n    </blockquote>\n    <ul>\n        <li>List item 1</li>\n        <li>List item 2</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>An in-text link: <a href=\"https://example.com/link\">The link text</a></p>\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit button</button>\n</article>\n```",
