The given source lacks traditional HTML markup found in web pages that we can use for extraction purposes. Nevertheless, I will provide a general guide on how to approach such a task for regular web pages:\n\n1. Scrape the HTML source code of the webpage using a tool like BeautifulSoup (Python), Jsoup (Java), or Cheerio (JS).\n2. Search for specific tags that indicate main content: <p>, <a>, <h1>-<h6>, <button>, <ul>, <ol>, and <blockquote>.\n3. Narrow the focus by excluding tags related to page furniture like headers, footers, navigation menus, sidebars, cookie banners, newsletter sign-up blocks, site-wide search, login links, and social media footers. You can do this by adding exclusion rules based on the pattern or location of those elements in relation to the content you are interested in.\n4. Strip out any remaining unwanted content using various Python methods like .strip(), .replace(), or regular expressions (regex).\n5. Preserve meaningful structural elements and return them in semantic HTML format for easier parsing and understanding.\n6. If necessary, you may further enhance the code with techniques such as recursion to handle nested structure.",
