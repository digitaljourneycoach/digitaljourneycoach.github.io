The LPA has published guidance on information required to be submitted with applications, which has been available on this webpage, for a number of years. Dealing with such a high percentage of invalid applications uses a significant amount of time and resources. This affects the timescales for processing applications, results in delays for the customer and puts pressure on existing staff.</p>\n<p>Administration charges are being introduced for the process of dealing with invalid applications. This is aimed at improving the quality of applications submitted to us and significantly increasing the number of applications valid at first submission. This will enable the planning support team to focus resources on the processing of applications rather than managing invalid applications.</p>\n<p>This new process, together with the LPA's recent review of the pre-application advice service, is expected to improve the overall customer experience for our clients.</p>\n<p>A new charge for invalid planning applications will come into effect from 9am on 2 December 2024. Invalid fees are as follows:</p>\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Application type</th>\n            <th>Invalid fee per attempt</th>\n            <th>Maximum attempts</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Householder</td>\n            <td>\u00a326</td>\n            <td>Three</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Other Planning Applications</td>\n            <td>\u00a363</td>\n            <td>Three</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>This charge will also apply if an invalid application is withdrawn after notification that it is invalid. This charge will be deducted from any fee refund.</p>\n<p>To avoid a charge for an invalid planning application, it is highly recommended that you consult the Council's Local Validation List prior to the submission of your application. The Council's <a href=\"https://www.fenland.gov.uk/media/21609/Local-List-Requirements/pdf/Local_Validation_List_December_2024.pdf?m=1732793936937\">Local Validation List</a> sets out the general requirements for planning applications. It has been updated to provide a clearer guide to what the Council needs for an application to be valid first time. If further advice is required, you will be able to utilize the Council's existing services to establish the complete range of documentation required.</p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"General\">General guidance: checklists and pro-forma</a></h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.fenland.gov.uk/media/16936/Cambridgeshire-County-Council-Drainage-Strategy-checklist/pdf/Drainage_strategy_checklist_-_Cambs_County_Council.pdf?m=1593090549977\">Cambridgeshire County Council Drainage Strategy checklist</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.fenland.gov.uk/media/15117/Ciria-SuDS-Manual-Sustainable-Drainage/pdf/CIRIA_-_The_SuDS_Manual_Sustainable_Drainage.pdf?m=1541761723433\">Ciria - The SuDs Manual (Sustainable Drainage)</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.fenland.gov.uk/media/16937/Waste-collection-requirements-for-domestic-properties/pdf/Waste_Planning_Guidance_for_Domestic_Properties_2022.pdf?m=1668078780977\">Waste collection requirements for domestic properties</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.fenland.gov.uk/media/17797/Fire-statement-form/doc/Fire_statement_form.docx?m=1628261780773\">Fire statement form</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.fenland.gov.uk/media/19285/Construction-Environmental-Management-Plan-Template/pdf/Construction_Environmental_Management_Plan_Template.pdf?m=1675855765807\">Construction Environmental Management Plan Template</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.fenland.gov.uk/article/18283/Self-Build-Declaration-form\">Demonstrating your scheme is self-build or custom-build housing form</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a id=\"Active\">Active Travel Toolkit for new developments</a></h3>\n<p>The Toolkit helps planning authorities, the County Council, and developers make decisions about prioritizing active travel for all scales of new developments in Cambridgeshire.
