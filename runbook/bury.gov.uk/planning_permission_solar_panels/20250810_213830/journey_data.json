The common project guides and interactive house on the Planning Portal will help you decide if a formal planning application is required.</p>\n<p>For details on permitted development rules, please visit the '<a title=\"do you need planning permission on the Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200125/do_you_need_permission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">do you need permission</a>' advice on the Planning Portal.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that in some cases there may be restrictions on your property which would mean you require planning consent and information provided is for guidance only. You should be satisfied that works do not need formal planning permission before commencing any works.</p>\n<p>You may need to obtain your own independent professional planning advice. Your proposals may also require <a title=\"building regulations approval\" href=\"/planning-building-control/building-regulations/consent\">building regulations approval</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Can you confirm that I do not require planning permission?</h2>\n<p>If you require a formal decision as to whether you need planning permission for your proposal that you consider your proposal is permitted development or that an existing use is lawful, you must apply for a Lawful Development Certificate.</p>\n<p>Please visit the Planning Portal for further information on <a title=\"development consent types and apply for a Lawful Development Certificate on the Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/planning/planning-applications/consent-types/lawful-development-certificate-ldc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">development consent types and apply online for a Lawful Development Certificate</a>.</p>\n<p>Confirmation will not be provided without the submission of a Lawful Development Certificate with supporting information upon which to base that opinion. A formal decision could also prove essential in the event of the sale of your property.</p>\n\n<h2>Would I get planning permission?</h2>\n<p>We recognise the value of pre-application discussions for the efficient handling of subsequent applications and therefore encourage those considering new development to engage in this process.</p>\n<p>If you wish to obtain our opinion on your proposal please visit our <a title=\"pre-application advice\" href=\"/planning-building-control/planning-permission/pre-application-advice\">pre-application advice</a> page for further information.</p>\n\n<h2>How do I submit my planning application?</h2>\n<p>Planning applications should preferably be submitted via the Planning Portal, however if you are unable to submit online please use the contact form below and we will advise on an alternative way to submit and pay for your application.</p>\n<p>The associated planning application fee will be calculated by the Planning Portal on submission or you can check using their <a title=\"Planning Portal fee calculator\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/app/fee-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fee calculator</a> and the fee must be made directly to the Planning Portal before the application will be released to us as the Local Planning Authority.</p>\n<p>For further information on what documents to submit please see our <a title=\"planning advice, validation checklists and criteria\" href=\"/planning-building-control/planning-permission/planning-application-process\">planning advice, validation checklists and criteria</a>.</p>\n<p>Also paper forms are available to download from the Planning Portal: <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/planning/planning-applications/paper-forms/find-and-download-paper-forms\">Find and download paper forms - Paper Forms - Planning Portal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://burymbc-self.achieveservice.com/AchieveForms/?&consentMessage=yes&form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-1e1ac6f3-589f-47d3-b8e5-0b8e4ff68aaf/AF-Stage-b664c699-b93e-4a8f-b5ac-4e5eb248714c/definition.json&process=1&process_uri=sandbox-processes://AF-Process-1e1ac6f3-589f-47d3-b8e5-0b8e4ff68aaf&process_id=AF-Process-1e1ac6f3-589f-47d3-b8e5-0b8e4ff68aaf\">Enquire about alternative ways to submit a planning application</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Who can comment on my planning application?</h2>\n<h3>Neighbours</h3>\n<p>Letters will be sent to neighbouring properties. These consultations direct neighbours to our <a title=\"Planning Search website\" href=\"https://planning.bury.gov.uk/online-applications/search.do?action=simple&searchType=Application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Planning website</a> where they can view the plans and comment on the application within a statutory 21 days.</p>\n<p>These comments will be taken into consideration by the Planning Officer and will be summarised in the final report with the recommendation for either approval or refusal. Any comments made will be publicly available and published online.</p>\n<p>The neighbouring properties notified in relation to an application will vary according to the situation of the site and its surroundings. However, it should be noted that you can comment on any application irrespective of whether a formal notification has been received or not.</p>\n<p>See our information on <a title=\"View and comment on planning applications and appeals\" href=\"/planning-building-control/planning-permission/consultations\">viewing and commenting on planning applications and appeals</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Internal and external consultees</h3>\n<p>We will consult any other relevant Council departments that may be able to provide the Planning Officer with professional advice, for example Highways or Drainage.</p>\n<p>It may also be necessary to consult with external authorities, for example Environment Agency or United Utilities. Ward councillors are also informed and given opportunity to comment.</p>\n<p>The consultations undertaken for any application will depend upon the nature and scale of the development proposed.</p>\n\n<h2>How do I comment on a current planning application?</h2>\n<p>Your comments must be made online via the <a title=\"Search planning applications website\" href=\"https://planning.bury.gov.uk/online-applications/search.do?action=simple&searchType=Application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Planning website</a>. For more information about commenting or appealing a planning application, please visit our <a title=\"planning consultations\" href=\"/planning-building-control/planning-permission/consultations\">planning consultations</a> page.</p>\n\n<h2>How will my planning application be considered?</h2>\n<p>The Planning case officer will review your application and make a site visit to get an understanding of the potential impact your development may have on neighbouring properties and the surrounding area. They will consider the consultation responses and carry out a further assessment of the proposals in respect of the relevant local and National Planning Policy Framework.</p>\n<p>Further advice is available on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>our <a title=\"supplementary planning advice\" href=\"/planning-building-control/policy-and-projects/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-advice\">supplementary planning advice</a> page</li>\n<li><a title=\"National Planning Policy Framework on GOV.UK\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Planning Policy Framework on GOV.UK</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases it may be necessary to seek amendment to enable the development to be acceptable. If the changes are considered minor, we may make a decision without any further publicity or in some cases it may be necessary to re-consult.</p>\n<p>At the end of the assessment period, the case officer will write their report setting out their recommendation. The application will either be approved, with or without conditions, or refused.</p>\n\n<h2>Will my application be considered at Planning Control committee?</h2>\n<p>Not necessarily, although the <a title=\"Planning Control committee\" href=\"/planning-building-control/planning-permission/planning-control-committee\">Planning Control committee</a> is a group of elected Councillors who are trained in making planning decisions, the majority of applications will be signed off by the Head of Development Management on behalf of the Director of BGI.</p>\n<p>This is because Development Management has the ability to make decisions where they fall under a set of agreed criteria - this is known as the Scheme of Delegation authorised by the Council's Constitution. Only those applications which fall outside of this criteria are considered by the Planning Control committee.</p>\n\n<h2>How long does it take to determine a planning application?</h2>\n<p>There are nationally set target dates that define when the Council should make a decision on an application.</p>\n<p>Typically, the target dates are a statutory eight weeks for minor planning applications and 13 weeks for major planning applications. So this will depend on the nature of the application and whether or not there are any issues to be addressed and the Planning Control Committee meeting dates. Therefore in some cases extensions of time may be needed and agreed.</p>\n\n<h2>What can I do if my planning application is refused?</h2>\n<p>You have two options; you can resubmit your application seeking to address the reasons for refusal and a revised application is free provided the application is of the same scale and nature and is made by the same applicant within 12 months of the date of refusal.</p>\n<p>If an application is approved, then planning permission is granted and there is no third-party right of appeal.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can <a title=\"submit an appeal about a planning decision\" href=\"/planning-building-control/planning-permission/planning-application-process\">submit an appeal</a> against the Council's decision to refuse to the Planning Inspectorate.</p>\n\n<h2>Do I need planning permission to work from home?</h2>\n<p>You do not necessarily need <a title=\"working from home planning permission advice on the Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission/common-projects/working-from-home/planning-permission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">planning permission to work from home</a>. The key test is whether the overall character of the dwelling will change as a result of the business. If the answer to any of the following questions is 'yes', then permission will likely be needed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is it still mainly a home or has it become business premises?</li>\n<li>will your home no longer be used mainly as a private residence?</li>\n<li>will your business result in a marked rise in traffic or people calling or deliveries?</li>\n<li>will your business involve any activities unusual in a residential area?</li>\n<li>will your business disturb your neighbours including at unreasonable hours or create other forms of nuisance such as noise or smells?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are in any doubt, you should apply for a Lawful Development Certificate for the proposed activity, to confirm it is not a change of use and the lawful use is still a dwelling.</p>\n\n<h3>Childminding at home</h3>\n<p>If there are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>less than 3 children being cared for, including the childminders' own, planning permission is not needed</li>\n<li>between 3 and 6 children, it is unlikely that planning permission would be needed but it would be advised that any new childminder applies for a Lawful Development Certificate to confirm the situation</li>\n<li>over 6 children, planning permission is likely to be required.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Do I need planning permission for a change of use?</h2>\n<p>Planning permission is not needed when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the existing and the proposed uses fall within the same Use Class or</li>\n<li>if the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) states that a change of class is permitted to another specified class.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further guidance on <a title=\"change of use guidance on the Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission/common-projects/change-of-use/use-classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">change of use</a> is available on the Planning Portal.</p>\n<p>If you require approval that a proposed change of use is permitted or our written confirmation of an existing use, you must submit a <a title=\"apply for a Lawful Development Certificate on the Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/planning/planning-applications/consent-types/lawful-development-certificate-ldc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lawful Development Certificate</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Do I need planning permission for a new vehicular access, driveway or hardstanding?</h2>\n<p>Provided you do not live on or want access from a classified road, such as a main thoroughfare or highway, you will not need planning permission if a new or replacement driveway of any size uses permeable or porous surfacing which allows water to drain through, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gravel</li>\n<li>permeable concrete block paving</li>\n<li>porous asphalt</li>\n<li>if the rainwater is directed to a lawn or border to drain naturally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See further guidance on <a title=\"paving your front garden on the Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission/common-projects/paving-your-front-garden/planning-permission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paving your front garden</a> on the Planning Portal.</p>\n<p>If you require our written confirmation as to whether you need planning permission for your new vehicular access or driveway, you must apply for a <a title=\"apply for a Lawful Development Certificate on the Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/planning/planning-applications/consent-types/lawful-development-certificate-ldc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lawful Development Certificate</a>.</p>\n<p>Whilst you may not need planning permission, if you're making a new access into the garden across the footpath you will need to obtain permission from the Highways Team to <a title=\"dropped kerbs\" href=\"/roads-travel-and-parking/highways-keep-bury-moving/dropped-kerbs\">drop the kerb</a> or to carry out works to the public highway including the footpath.</p>\n\n<h2>Do I need planning permission to convert a garage to a habitable room?</h2>\n<p>Planning permission is not usually required, providing the work is internal and does not involve enlarging the building.</p>\n<p>If you want to convert a garage into a separate house, regardless of who will occupy it, then planning permission will be required no matter what work is involved.</p>\n<p>Sometimes permitted development rights have been removed from some properties with regard to garage conversions and therefore you should check before proceeding, particularly if you live on a new housing development, in a listed building, or in a conservation area.</p>\n<p>Visit the <a title=\"advice on garage conversions on the Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission/common-projects/garage-conversion/planning-permission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Planning Portal for advice on garage conversions</a>.
