However, this may not be the best position to minimise the effect on the external appearance of the building and the amenity of the area.</p>\n            <p>Of suitable locations identified, the visual impact of the panels will be most significant when positioned on roof slopes visible from public views. Wherever possible, panels should therefore be positioned in an area where they are the least visible. It is accepted that in certain cases this may not be reasonably practicable, especially if there is only one suitable roof location.</p>\n            <p>There are a number of ways the visual impact of panels can be reduced, and the following list should be used to determine whether solar panels are sited &acirc;&#128;&#152;so far as practicable&acirc;&&#128;&#153; to minimise their effect:</p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Applicants should demonstrate that the chosen location is the most suitable in terms of exposure to the greatest amount of sunlight to maximise efficiency. This should be supported with evidence from the provider and an explanation as to the impact on the efficiency of the units if the panels were located on an alternative roofslope, less visible from public viewpoints</li>\n                <li>When the specific roof slope has been selected, applicants should demonstrate how the visual impact has been minimised:<br>a) The panels have been evenly spaced on the roof slope and not in an irregular pattern<br>b) The panels have been positioned to retain even distances to roof margins (ridge, eaves, party walls) and/or wall margins<br>c) The panels have where possible been placed behind parapets or roof features such as chimneys, where these features do not cause shading issues<br>d) Cabling has been located to minimise visibility and colours are in keeping with the colour of the building exterior</li>\n            </ol>\n            <p>The points above should be discussed with your contractor to minimise the visual impact of the installation.</p>\n            <h2>If you need planning permission</h2>\n            <p>If you need to do so, you can apply for planning permission online through the Planning Portal website.
