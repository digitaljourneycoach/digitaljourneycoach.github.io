This would be done by attaching a condition to a planning permission. When conditions are attached to a planning permission they are listed on the decision notice for the application. You can view decision notices by viewing the Documents tab of an application: <a href=\"/dio/search-planning-applications\" title=\"Search for planning applications\">Search planning applications</a>.</p>\n  <p>The Council can also introduce an <a href=\"/node/1823#id-3.9-notices,-orders,-directions-and-proceedings-under-planning-acts\">Article 4 direction</a> (under Question 3.9j). This restricts the scope of permitted development rights to a particular area or type of development. If this happens, then planning permission may then be required.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"/planning-and-building-control/building-control/building-regulations\" title=\"Building regulations\">Building regulations</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/business-services/licences/business\" title=\"Business licences\">Business licences</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/planning-and-building-control/conservation\" title=\"Conservation\">Conservation areas controls</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/planning-and-building-control/conservation\" title=\"Conservation\">Listed building consent</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/maps/tree-preservation-orders-and-conservation-areas\" title=\"Tree Preservation Orders and Conservation Areas\">Tree Preservation Orders</a>.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Lawful development certificate (LDC) for a proposed development/use (Section 192)</h2>\n  <p>You can request a <strong>Lawful Development Certificate</strong> (LDC) for a proposed development or use. Decisions are made within eight weeks of getting all the documents and fees that are needed. The LDC gives written confirmation of whether the Council considers your proposal to be lawful. This can be kept with your deeds and used in the event of the sale of your property.</p>\n  <p>There is a right of appeal to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate\">Planning inspectorate</a> against any decision which is made on an LDC.</p>\n  <h3>Requesting a LDC</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Visit: <a href=\"http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/PpApplications/genpub/en/CreateApplication\">Submit an online planning application</a>;</li>\n    <li>or send your application form by email: <a href=\"mailto:planning.applications@calderdale.gov.uk\">planning.applications@calderdale.gov.uk</a>.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>The form can also be sent to <a href=\"/planning-and-building-control/contact-planning-services\" title=\"Contact Planning Services\">Planning Services</a>.</p>\n  <p>The fee should be paid at the same time. This is half the cost of a planning application fee, see: <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/app/fee-calculator?region=1\">Planning fees calculator</a>.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>If you submit your application on the Planning Portal, you will need to pay at the point you submit it.</li>\n    <li>If you email your application to us, you can pay by credit/debit card over the phone, call: 01422 392237.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>Supporting paperwork</h3>\n  <p>Along with the completed form, we also need a location map. This must have the application site outlined in red. Any other land in the same ownership should be outlined in blue. A scale of 1:1250 is preferable, but no less than 1:25000 and include the North point.</p>\n  <p>To buy Ordnance Survey plans, visit: <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/\">Planning Portal</a>.</p>\n\n  <h2>Planning history</h2>\n  <p>Our online Planning Application System can provide details of the planning application history on a site back to 1974.</p>\n  <p>If you find the application numbers, to make a request, email: <a href=\"mailto:planning.applications@calderdale.gov.uk\">planning.applications@calderdale.gov.uk</a>. We can then get the key documents from the files put online.</p>\n  <p>We can provide the planning history of a site for you. The cost of this service depends on the time period and type of property/site:</p>\n  <table>\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Property</th>\n        <th>Records searched</th>\n        <th>Charge</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Single house</td>\n        <td>Digital planning history records back to 1977.</td>\n        <td>\u00a348</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n\n  <h2>Will I get planning permission?</h2>\n  <p>Planning applications can take time to prepare. They will also cost money to submit. In most cases there is a planning fee. You may have to pay for plans to be drawn and reports to be prepared. Before you submit an application it could be useful to see if you are likely to get permission.</p>\n  <p>There are a number of options available to help you with this.</p>\n  <h3>Own Research</h3>\n  <p>Answer these questions to help you find out if there are likely to be issues with your application:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>What is the site allocated for on our adopted <a href=\"/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy/local-plan\" title=\"Local Plan\">Local Plan</a>.
