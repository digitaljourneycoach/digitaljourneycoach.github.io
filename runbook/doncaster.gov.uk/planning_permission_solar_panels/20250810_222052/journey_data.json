If so, you may formally apply to the Council for a Certificate of Lawful Development.</p>\n<p>The Check Now service is <strong>not </strong>an official planning decision that you can rely on in future. It is also not a formal decision as to whether planning permission would be granted. If you require a formal decision as to whether a use or development, proposed or existing is lawful you should submit an application for a Certificate of Lawful Development.

This means that extensions of over four and up to eight metres for detached houses and over three and up to six metres for all other houses, must go through this process.</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong><a title=\"Larger Home Extension Scheme\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200130/common_projects/17/extensions/2\" target=\"_blank\">Larger Home Extension Scheme on the Planning Portal</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Building Regulations</h2>\n<p>Please remember that even if you do not require planning permission you may still require a separate approval under the Building Regulations. For further information please visit our <a title=\"Building Control website\" href=\"https://www.doncaster.gov.uk/services/planning/building-control\" target=\"_blank\">Building Control website</a>.</p>\n<p>In some cases where you do not need to apply for planning permission you will still need to apply for approval to carry out works to protected trees; or some other form of statutory consent. It is the applicant's duty to ensure that all necessary consents are in place before carrying out a development.</p>\n<h2>Work carried out on trees</h2>\n<p>Any pruning or felling of a Tree covered by a Tree Preservation Order will require consent. Any works to Trees in a Conservation Area require six weeks notice in writing. For the planning application forms please refer to the</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong><a title=\"Planning Portal\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/applications\" target=\"_blank\">Planning Portal</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For further information/advice relating to Trees and Hedgerows contact:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>01302 734419</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Demolition of a building</h2>\n<p>Permission is not always needed to demolish a building. However, there are situations where permission is required, so you are advised to check with a Planning Officer before demolition is carried out.</p>\n<p>Planning permission may also be required to re-build a demolished or partly demolished building and to demolish buildings and structures within a Conservation Area.  </p>\n<h2>Change of use</h2>\n<p>The use of a building or an area of land will fall into a category within the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). </p>\n<p>The current Use Classes were last updated on 1 September 2020. It covers such uses as Shops, Food and Drink, Financial and Professional Services, Business, General Industry, Storage and Distribution, Dwelling Houses, Residential Institutions, Hotels, Non-residential Institutions, HMO's, Assembly and Leisure. Some uses fall into 'Sui Generis' (a Latin term, in this context meaning 'a class of its own'), such as nightclubs, drinking establishments/wine bars, betting offices/shops, hot food takeaways, large HMO (more than 6 residents), bingo halls. Other uses become 'Sui Generis' where they fall outside the defined limits of any other use class.</p>\n<p>Changing the use from one category to another may require planning permission, however, any use class changes within the same use class category may not need further permission. It should be noted that there is also a possibility conditions may be attached to previous permission restricting use.</p>\n<p>Even where a change of use does not require planning permission, where a change of use is accompanied by other building operations, particularly external works, then those works may require planning permission.</p>\n<p>To establish if planning permission is required or not for your proposed change of use and/or seek proof for business/financial purposes you can formally apply to the Council for a Certificate of Lawful Development. This may require you to submit drawings of your proposal and pay a fee. Alternatively, you could apply for a Planning History check to find out if any restrictive conditions are attached to the current permission (see above).</p>\n<p>To find out more about the specific uses within the Use Classes Order visit:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong><a title=\"Change of Use\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200130/common_projects/9/change_of_use\" target=\"_blank\">Planning Portal - change of use</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Outdoor advertisements</h2>\n<p>Express consent is required for the majority of outdoor advertisements, including shop signs and poster boards. For example, all illuminated adverts require consent. There are, however, certain exceptions. You should contact the Planning Department to find out if you will require consent for your proposed advert/s, currently this would be \"over the phone\" advice to give a helpful reply rather than any formal notification.</p>\n<p>The links below give more detailed advice on the limitations for advertisements and a handy guide produced by the Communities and Local Government:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong><a title=\"Adverts and Signs\" href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200130/common_projects/4/adverts_and_signs\" target=\"_blank\">Adverts and signs</a></strong></li>\n    <li><strong><a title=\"Outdoor advertisements\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/outdoor-advertisements-and-signs-a-guide-for-advertisers\" target=\"_blank\">Outdoor advertisements</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>More Information</h2>\n<h3>Privacy Notice&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>The Council is committed to meeting its data protection obligations and handling your information securely.
