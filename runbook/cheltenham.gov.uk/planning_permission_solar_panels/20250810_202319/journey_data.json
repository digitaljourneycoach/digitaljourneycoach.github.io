If issued, this certificate confirms that planning permission is not necessary for your proposal and can prove very helpful should you come to sell your property in the future. For details of how to submit this type of application visit <a href=\"https://www.cheltenham.gov.uk/info/12/planning_and_development/1365/certificate_of_lawful_proposed_use_or_development\" title=\"our page about CLPUD\">our page about CLPUD</a>.</p>\n\n        <p>If you do need planning permission for your works, you may wish to discuss your proposal further with one of our development management team. We offer a range of pre-application services, which are set out below.</p>\n\n        <h2>Duty officer telephone appointments</h2>\n\n        <p>If you'd like to discuss your proposal via a telephone appointment, we have a duty planning officer available at different times throughout the week.</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>Mondays and Thursdays: 11am to 1pm (last appointment 12.30pm)</li>\n            <li>Wednesday: 2pm to 4pm (last appointment 3.30pm)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>The fee for this service is &pound;90&nbsp;per appointment and appointments will last no more than 25 minutes.</p>\n\n        <p>Please note that before the appointment can be booked, you will need to pay the fee and submit any relevant information.</p>\n\n        <p>During your appointment, we'll give valuable advice on how likely your proposals are to gain planning permission, how you can best improve these chances (if necessary) and what information we need to register your application. This can save you time and money when it comes to submitting your application. The more information you can provide ahead of the meeting, the more productive the appointment will be. There will be occasions where a site visit for householder development may be helpful. If this is the case, the officer can advise you on the other pre-application services we offer.</p>\n\n        <h2>Householder pre-applications</h2>\n\n        <p>If a duty officer appointment is not suitable for your householder development, or if you need a more detailed service, such as a written response, a meeting and/or a site visit, we offer a more formal householder pre-application service that may be more suitable.</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>a written response</li>\n            <li>a meeting and written response</li>\n            <li>a site visit and written response</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Note: meetings will be held virtually (either by telephone or via video call) and any meeting or site visit will last no more than 30 minutes.</p>\n\n        <p>You will need to complete a pre-application form, provide the required information, pay the relevant fee and submit to us for processing. A pre-application submission will only be valid once we've received all relevant information and payment.&nbsp; Officers will then strive to provide a written response within 15 working days.</p>\n\n        <p>The relevant fees for the different levels of service can be found in our <a href=\"http://www.cheltenham.gov.uk/info/79/planning_pre-application_advice/1755/guide_to_planning_services/8\" title=\"fee schedule\">fee schedule</a><strong>.</strong> Please note, if specialist comments are required, there may be additional fees.</p>\n\n        <h2>How to request the service</h2>\n\n        <p>For more information on how to book an appointment, how to make payment and how to submit the necessary information, visit our page about <a href=\"https://www.cheltenham.gov.uk/info/79/planning_pre-application_advice/1755/guide_to_planning_services/7\" title=\"submitting a request for pre-application advice\">submitting a request for pre-application advice</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n</article>\n```",
