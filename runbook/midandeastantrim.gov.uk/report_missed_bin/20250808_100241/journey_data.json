The page features a navigation menu on the left side with various sections like \"Missed Collections\", \"Grants and Funding\", \"Environmental Health\", \"Community Planning\", etc.\n\nThe main content area is divided into three columns: a sidebar on the left highlighting important information related to missed collections, a hero image in the middle showcasing a photograph of bins, and a content area on the right providing detailed information about missed collections for different types of bins (black, brown, blue, kerbie boxes). The page also includes an alert box that reminds users to check their correct bin collection day before reporting a missed collection.\n\nThe layout utilizes a grid system with classes like `grid-row` and `col-1`, `col-2-3`, etc., likely provided by a CSS framework such as Bootstrap. The page also contains references to various internal and external links, such as \"Council Direct\" and the link to Bryson Recycling's contact page. Finally, it seems there is code for a cookie consent bar at the bottom of the page that currently does not appear to be shown.",
