Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. The page informs users about what to do when their bins or boxes are not collected within two working days of being reported.\n2. Users should verify they have reported after 12 noon on their collection day, ensured that the bin/box was out by 7am, placed on the property boundary, the correct collection day, and was not stickered due to contamination.\n3. If users fail to report a missed collection within two working days, they will need to wait until the next collection or take their waste to the Household Waste and Recycling Centre on Caxton Way or to one of the recycling banks.\n4. The page also advises users if their bins contain items not accepted by the collection crews, their contents will not be removed, and a sticker detailing the nature of the contaminating item(s) will be placed on the bin/box to inform them why it was not collected. Users should remove any non-acceptable items before placing their bins out for collection on their next scheduled day.\n5. The page links to related resources like the Household Waste Management Policy, your bin collections, recycling centre, and recycling banks pages, as well as a form to report a missed collection.\n6. Lastly, an external link icon indicates that some links, like the Household Waste Management Policy document, open in a new tab or window.",
