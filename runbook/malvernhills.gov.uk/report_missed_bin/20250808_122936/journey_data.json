You can <a href=\"https://swict.malvernhills.gov.uk/mhdcroundlookup/\">check your bin collection day</a> to find out what bin to put out and when.</p>\n<p>To help our bin collection crews please make sure:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Your bin is at the boundary of your home nearest the public highway (road or path).</li>\n    <li>You put your bin out by 7am on the day of your collection.</li>\n    <li>The lid is closed. We may not collect your bin if the lid isn\u2019t fully closed.</li>\n    <li>All waste is in the bin. We do not collect waste left at the side of bins. If you have too much recycling you can put it in a clear sack or recyclable container next to the bin or you can ask for an <a href=\"https://swict.malvernhills.gov.uk/sw2wasteandrecyclingmhdc/mhdc_enquiryselect.jsp\">extra green recycling bin.</a> Just select add/remove/replace bin or sack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will only empty bins we have provided and have our name and logo on them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/waste-and-recycling/bins-and-collections/what-happens-to-your-waste\">Find out what happens to your waste</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"BinNotCollected\">My bin hasn\u2019t been collected</h2>\n<p>If you have put your bin out correctly and it still hasn\u2019t been emptied then please tell us by using our <a href=\"https://swict.malvernhills.gov.uk/sw2wasteandrecyclingmhdc/mhdc_enquiryselect.jsp\">missed bin online reporting form.</a></p>\n<p>If bin collections are not taking place as normal, because of roadworks, snow, ice, flooding or for other reasons, we will put information on this page. You can also <a href=\"https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKMHDC/subscriber/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sign up to our waste and recycling e-newsletter</a> to get information sent directly to your inbox as well as advice on waste reduction and recycling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"CollectionDate\">Find your bin collection date</h2>\n<p>If you have forgotten what bin to put out when or would like to know when your usual collection day is, then use our online calendar.

This year\u2019s sacks will be delivered during July and August. If you have not received your sacks by 2nd September please contact us.</p>\n<p>Sacks are collected on an alternate weekly basis; cherry recycling sacks one week and black sacks the next. You can put out a maximum of 4 black sacks per fortnightly collection. We will only issue one roll of black sacks per year. If you require more, these will need to be purchased by yourself.</p>\n<p>On the week of your recycling collection you can put out as many cherry sacks as you like. You can get extra recycling sacks by requesting them from our website.</p>\n<p>Sacks must be put out by the boundary of your home by 7am on the day of your collection.</p>\n<p>You can dispose of broken glass in your black sack providing it is securely wrapped. You cannot put glass into your cherry sacks all glass bottles and jars should be taken to Household Recycling Centres (HRCs) or use your local recycling banks.</p>\n<p><a class=\"cta-button\" href=\"https://swict.malvernhills.gov.uk/sw2wasteandrecyclingmhdc/mhdc_enquiryselect.jsp\">Request Cherry Recycling Sacks</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"HelpPutBinsOut\">Help putting your bin or sacks out</h2>\n<p>If you're not able to place your bin at the edge of your property on your own because of age or disability, you can request an assisted collection from your property.
