This development is called permitted development.</p>\n\n<h2>Check if your project needs planning permission</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s likely you will need planning permission if you\u2019re:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>building something new</li>\n    <li>extending or altering a building used as flats or a commercial building</li>\n    <li>changing the use of all or part of a building</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some types of development do not need planning permission. We call this \u2018permitted development\u2019.</p>\n<p>The Planning Portal website has <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200130/common_projects\">guidance on planning permission for common projects.</a> For example, loft conversions and smaller single storey house extensions.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://interactive.planningportal.co.uk/\">check planning permission guidance for different property types</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>How to get proof that your development is legal</h3>\n<p>You can apply for a <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200130/common_projects/120/what_to_do_next/3\">lawful development certificate</a>. This will confirm your building work is permitted development.</p>\n<p>It costs \u00a3129 for householders. We will then issue a certificate within 8 weeks.</p>\n<p>This is not the same as planning permission but is proof that your household building work is legal.</p>\n\n<h3>Larger home extensions</h3>\n<p>Legislation now allows the building of larger single-storey rear extensions. The new size limits are subject to a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-8fBO5EA5T_cY9A0CQ4PSMxe5YbugxBd\">neighbour consultation scheme</a>. You must provide the information in the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-03WcHI3KjWShStedm5kk-FQhytiEKDV\">prior approval checklist</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Changing buildings from office to residential use</h2>\n<p>You can change some buildings from office to residential use without planning permission. This depends on where the property is in Hackney.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GPTb5C-6GM2X00FENuaiZZJbnMFTgJDv/view\">View map showing office to residential use areas</a></p>\n<p>You will need prior approval covering:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>flooding</li>\n    <li>highways</li>\n    <li>transport issues</li>\n    <li>contamination</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prior approval means an applicant has to get an agreement from the council. This states which parts of the development are acceptable before work can proceed.</p>\n\n<h2>Flats</h2>\n<p>It is likely any development work to a flat needs planning permission. The <a href=\"https://interactive.planningportal.co.uk/flat-and-shop/outside-flat-and-shop\">Planning Portal website</a> has guidance on planning permission for flats.</p>\n\n<h2>Conservation areas</h2>\n<p>Planning permission rules are different if your property is in a conservation area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackney.gov.uk/conservation-areas\">Find out if your property or site is in a conservation area</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Green homes</h2>\n<p>You can go green in your homes. The information below outlines a few common developments householders are interested in.</p>\n<p>If you are proposing works or developments not mentioned below, please contact the duty planner to determine whether planning permission is required.</p>\n\n<h3>Do I need planning permission for any renewable energy installations?</h3>\n<p>We support the use of microgeneration technologies in the borough. However, it is essential to make sure that the appropriate technology is chosen for your property.</p>\n<p>Microgeneration is defined under the Energy Act 2004 as &lt;45kWs (micro-heat) and &lt;50kWs (micro-electricity). Microgeneration can refer to community scale energy which may fall within these capacities.</p>\n<p>In general, solar thermal, photovoltaic and air source heat pump installations are considered most appropriate in dense urban environments such as Hackney.</p>\n<p>Wood and biomass burners, and micro-CHP, can be considered but have air quality impacts, whilst wind turbines are unlikely to be suitable.</p>\n<p>Installers who are <a href=\"http://www.microgenerationcertification.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS)</a> accredited will be able to provide information about which technology is most appropriate for your property and the planning requirements associated with the technology you are proposing to install.</p>\n<p>Independent professional advice should be gained before any building works are carried out.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether planning permission is needed, you may be required to meet Building Regulations.

All additional installations will require planning permission</li>\n    <li>the installation complies with the MCS Planning Standards</li>\n    <li>the external unit is not located where it can be seen from the road and is in a place that minimises visual impact</li>\n    <li>the external unit is not located on a pitched roof</li>\n    <li>the external unit is not bigger than 0.6m3</li>\n    <li>all parts of the heat pump are a minimum 1 metre distance from the boundary of the property</li>\n    <li>when the technology is no longer being used it is removed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some ASHP units are noisy and can have a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties.</p>\n<p>These should be fully discussed with a registered installer and with the Council prior to installation.</p>\n\n<h3>What are my options for improving insulation in my house?</h3>\n<p>The most suitable way of insulating your home will depend on the way in which it was originally built, and how much insulation is already in place.</p>\n<h4>Wall insulation</h4>\n<p>Most walls in Hackney are built of brick and are either cavity walls or solid walls. In general, homes built before the 1920s have solid walls, whilst those built afterwards have cavities.</p>\n<p>You can check by following the guidance on the <a href=\"https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/solid-wall-insulation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Energy Saving Trust</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have cavity walls, filling them with insulating foam can be extremely cost effective. Ask a registered installer to assess whether your property is suitable. You can find one by calling 0800 512 012.</p>\n<p>If you have solid walls, insulating them is likely to be a harder and more expensive process, but it can be done.</p>\n<p>You can choose between insulating the inside walls of your home, or the outside walls.</p>\n<p>For more information about these options visit the <a href=\"https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/solid-wall-insulation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Energy Saving Trust</a>.</p>\n<p>If you live in a <a href=\"https://www.hackney.gov.uk/conservation-areas\">conservation area</a> you will need to make sure any changes to the outside of your property fall within planning regulations.</p>\n<h4>Loft insulation</h4>\n<p>If you have a loft you can insulate its floor or the inside of the roof. You can find out more on the <a href=\"https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/roof-and-loft-insulation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Energy Saving Trust</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a flat roof you can also insulate it, generally by adding rigid insulating board on top of the existing roof covering.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you are having your flat roof replaced, you must fit insulation in order to comply with building regulations. You can read more on the Energy Saving Trust website.</p>\n<h4>Windows and draughts</h4>\n<p>All properties lose heat through their windows, and this can be particularly noticeable in older properties.</p>\n<p>You can reduce the amount of heat lost by installing double or triple glazing.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can fit permanent or temporary secondary glazing. You can find more information on the Energy Saving Trust website.</p>\n<p>If you live in a <a href=\"https://www.hackney.gov.uk/conservation-areas\">conservation area</a> you will need to make sure any changes to your windows fall within planning regulations.</p>\n<p>Draughts let in cold air and release your home\u2019s warmth into the atmosphere. They are most often found around windows, doors, suspended floor boards, pipework which leads outside and keyholes and letterboxes.</p>\n<p>You can draught-proof your home using DIY materials, or pay for professional installation. You can find out more about your options on the <a href=\"https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/draught-proofing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Energy Saving Trust</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Do I need planning permission if I want to insulate the walls of my home?</h3>\n<p>If the insulation is going to be fitted internally planning permission is not required.</p>\n<p>If the insulation is going to be fitted externally and will result in a change in the appearance of the building, planning permission or listed building consent will be required.</p>\n<p>External wall insulation must comply with Building Regulations.
