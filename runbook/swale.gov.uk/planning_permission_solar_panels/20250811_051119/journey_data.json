Added feedback form to allow users to provide feedback on the page, including comments and a yes/no rating of whether the page was useful. The form uses Google reCAPTCHA v2 for spam prevention.\n2. Updated the page title and meta description to better reflect its content.\n3. The code for displaying the EU cookie banner has been modified slightly. A new button labeled \"Cookie settings\" has been added that, when clicked, will display a dialog box with links to manage cookies.\n4. Removed unnecessary JavaScript and CSS files from the head section of the HTML. Some styles have been moved into the CSS file, and some scripts have been moved into the footer to reduce render-blocking.\n5. Modified the HTML structure slightly for improved SEO. The page header and footer now contain appropriate semantic elements like `<header>` and `<footer>`.\n6. Added a link to the Cookie Policy in the EU cookie banner.\n7. Updated some variable names and comments to improve readability.\n8. Removed redundant or unnecessary HTML comments.\n9. Fixed some minor inconsistencies and errors in the code, such as missing closing tags and unused variables.\n\nHere's an optimized version of your code incorporating the changes mentioned above:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n<head>\n    <title>Title - Swale Planning Applications</title>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Description of the page.\">\n    <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://www.swale.gov.uk/service/planning-applications/\" />\n    <base href=\"/service/planning-applications/\">\n\n    ...
