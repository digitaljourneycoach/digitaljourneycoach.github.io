Those families who appear to qualify for free school meals, but haven&rsquo;t applied yet, are currently being contacted by letter to explain how the <strong>assisted enrolment service</strong> works.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As well as providing valuable benefit directly to families, the more pupils registered correctly for free school meals will help schools receive the right level of funding from the government to support disadvantaged children known as <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium/pupil-premium\">Pupil Premium funding</a>. For each child on free school meals in a primary school, pupil premium provides &pound;1,455 per pupil to their school and &pound;1,035 per high school child per year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/schools-and-learning/free-school-meals/school-holiday-vouchers/\" title=\"School holiday vouchers\">School holiday vouchers</a></p>\n<p><span>Most free school meal applications need to be made to Salford City Council. Details of how to apply are set out below.</span></p>\n<p><strong>However, there are a small number of schools where you need to contact the school directly.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Schools where you need to apply directly</strong> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contact these schools directly for free school meal enquiries or new applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Barton Moss Primary School</li>\n<li>Buile Hill Academy</li>\n<li>Ellesmere Park High School</li>\n<li>Marlborough Road Academy</li>\n<li>Moorside High School</li>\n<li>St Augustine's CE Primary School</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Already receiving a Free School Meal?</strong></p>\n<p>If your child was eligible for income related Free School Meals during the last school year (2024/2025), they will continue to be eligible until the end of the 2025/2026 school year, in line with the government's <a href=\"/schools-and-learning/free-school-meals/transitional-protection-for-free-school-meals/\" title=\"Transitional protection for free school meals\">transitional protection</a>. <strong>There is no need to reapply for the 2025/2026 school year!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who qualifies for Free School Meals?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Free school meals are for children who:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>live in the City of Salford (the area covered by Salford City Council);<strong>and</strong></li>\n<li>go to school (not a day nursery or children's centre) in Greater Manchester (Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale,<strong>Salford,</strong>Stockport, Tameside, Trafford or Wigan)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you live outside the city of Salford, but your child goes to a Salford school, complete the online form below.</p>\n<p>Free meals are not usually available for children who go to independent (private) schools.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is entitled to free school meals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>registered pupils at primary and secondary free schools, academies and local authority maintained schools (including a sixth form centre attached to a maintained school); and</li>\n<li>pupils attending maintained nurseries, as long as they are receiving education before and after lunch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Your child may be able to get free school meals if you get any of the following:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Income Support</li>\n<li>Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance</li>\n<li>Income-related employment and support allowance</li>\n<li>The guaranteed element of State Pension Credit</li>\n<li>Universal Credit (not working)</li>\n<li>Universal Credit (working) where your net earned income is no more than &pound;7,400 a year.<strong>*</strong></li>\n<li>Child Tax Credit, provided they are <strong>not</strong> also entitled to <strong>Working Tax Credit</strong> and have an annual gross income of no more than &pound;16,190</li>\n<li>Where a parent is entitled to Working Tax Credit Run-on, paid for four weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</li>\n<li>If you get support under <strong>part VI</strong> of the <strong>Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>*Please note:</strong> To be entitled to claim free school meals (FSM) when working and claiming Universal Credit, your net earned income for one period should be no more than &pound;616.67, no more than &pound;1,233.34 for two consecutive payment periods, and no more than &pound;1,850.00 for three consecutive payment periods.</p>\n<p>Therefore if your net earned income for one, two or three periods are below the upper earnings limits stated, you would be entitled to claim FSM.</p>\n<p>When you apply online, you will need to upload screen shots of each page of the relevant payment statement(s), especially the page(s) showing any deductions that are being made, with your online application, so we can then determine if you are entitled to claim free school meals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, if your net earned income exceed the limits for one period, &pound;616.67, or two periods &pound;1,233.34, or three periods exceed &pound;1,850.00, then you would not qualify to claim FSM.</p>\n<p>Children who receive any of the above benefits in their own right (for example they get payments directly, instead of through a parent or guardian) can also get free school meals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits of registering</strong></p>\n<p>Even if your child won't have the school lunch, registering helps schools receive 'pupil premium' for each eligible child, used for useful services or extra support (e.g., music lessons, school trips).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Universal Infant Free School Meals (UIFSM)</strong></p>\n<p>Reception, year 1, and year 2 pupils in state-funded schools are eligible for UIFSM, regardless of parents' income.</p>\n<p>Discuss with the school staff to fill in an application form if necessary.</p>\n<p>In addition to UIFSM, if you do meet the criteria for claiming income related or asylum seeker free school meals, as outlined above, then please submit an online claim, so that your child&rsquo;s school can receive additional Pupil Premium funding from the Government.</p>\n\n<p><strong>16 to 19 funding: free meals in further education</strong></p>\n<p>Parents of children who are 16 and over, who are attending a further education college or a sixth form centre (not attached to a school), <strong>must</strong> apply to their child's college for free meals if they get a qualifying income listed above.</p>\n\n<h2>Application options</h2>\n<h3>Apply online:</h3>\n<p><strong>Parents</strong>: Use the appropriate online
