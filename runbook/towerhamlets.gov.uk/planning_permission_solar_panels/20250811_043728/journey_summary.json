This link has a higher relevance factor and provides residents with an interactive tool to determine whether they require planning permission for their building project, including information on permitted development without planning permission.\n\nWhile recommendations 2 and 5 are also valuable resources that provide useful guidelines about designing mansard roof extensions and incorporating solar panels during the construction process respectively, they have a lower confidence score compared to recommendation 1. Recommendation number 3 is not included because it has a confidence score below the specified minimum of 60 mentioned in the options.\n\nThis selection should help the user quickly understand if they require planning permission before making decisions about their building projects, which is an optimal next step since obtaining necessary permissions early in the process can save time and effort.",
