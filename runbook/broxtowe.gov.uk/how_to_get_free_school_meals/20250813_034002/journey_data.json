Additionally, it provides links to relevant contacts and includes a modal (SupportingLinksModal) that displays additional supporting links.\n\nThe left navigation sidebar shows different categories of benefits-related services under \"Household Support Fund.\" These include Council Tax Support, Housing Benefits, Overpayments, Fraud, Online Account, Universal Credit, Grant Aid for Voluntary Organizations and Individuals Involved in Sport and The Arts, and Benefits Advisor.\n\nThe content side of the page explains that individuals can't apply to the fund themselves; instead, they need to be referred by a professional who is already supporting them, such as food banks, adult social care, housing, care organizations, registered charities, children's services, and more. The eligibility examples are households identified as being in immediate need, those with utility arrears or using food banks, receiving Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support, experiencing considerable in-work poverty, victims of domestic abuse, and more.\n\nThe page also provides links to detailed information about the fund on the Nottinghamshire County Council website. Finally, it includes a close button for closing the modal with supporting links, although the modal doesn't appear to be populated with content according to the provided code snippet.",
