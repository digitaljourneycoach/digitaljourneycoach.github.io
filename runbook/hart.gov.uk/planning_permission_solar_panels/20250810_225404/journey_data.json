The main content area contains two sections:\n   - Introduction to the community solar panel installation project with information about its benefits, cost savings, reducing carbon footprint, and environmental impact.\n   - Information about how homeowners can get involved in the project, including steps they need to take (e.g., sign-up for an assessment, choose a system size, and agree to terms) and the financial benefits they can expect (e.g., lower electricity bills, potential savings on property taxes).\n4. A footer with links to related content (e.g., solar panel FAQs, energy-saving tips, and contact information for further inquiries).\n5. There is also a script at the bottom that enables a feedback form for visitors who would like to provide comments or suggestions about the webpage. They can rate the page's helpfulness, suggest improvements, send an email for feedback, and submit their comments.",
