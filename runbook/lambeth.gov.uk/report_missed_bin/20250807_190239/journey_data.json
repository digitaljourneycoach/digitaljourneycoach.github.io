For example, if your bin:</p>\n\n         <ul>\n            <li>was not left for collection at the front of your property</li>\n            <li>contained waste that should be in a different bin</li>\n            <li>was over-filled, preventing the lid from closing</li>\n         </ul>\n\n         <p>In these cases, you'll have to wait for your next collection day.</p>\n\n         <h2>Report a missed collection</h2>\n\n         <p>You should check your <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"758efd0c-aecf-4aca-8c04-e412c4ec81d5\" href=\"/street-cleaning-rubbish-recycling/check-your-bin-collection-day\" title=\"Check your bin collection day\">bin collection day</a> before you make your report.</p>\n\n         <p><a class=\"cta-link cta-link--arrow cta-link--primary\" href=\"https://wasteservice.lambeth.gov.uk/missedcollection/form\">Report a missed bin collection</a></p>\n\n         <h2>If your recycling has not been collected</h2>\n\n         <p>Your green recycling wheelie bin can only have <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"c840f5e8-5a3c-4661-ac21-170db19143c8\" href=\"/rubbish-recycling/recycling-collections\" title=\"Recycling collections\">items that we can recycle</a>&nbsp;in it.</p>\n\n         <p>Our staff will put a swinging tag on your green bin if they believe it contains the wrong materials.</p>\n\n         <p>If a tag has been put on your recycling bin, remove the non-recyclable items, then remove the tag.</p>\n\n         <p>Your recycling will then be collected on your next collection day.</p>\n\n         <p>If your electrical items and batteries have not been collected, it is likely due to the vehicle being full.
