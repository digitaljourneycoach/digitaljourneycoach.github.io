However, the objective is to select three options based on the given context and restrictions. The selections are made by considering various priority factors: Relevance 30%, Credibility 15%, Information_depth 30%, Novelty 5%, Accessibility 20%.\n\nThe selected recommendations prioritize resources that offer a direct link for reporting a missed bin collection, as well as those with higher information depth and relevance. The options provided are ordered based on their confidence scores and ranked from the most to least confident suggestions. In this case, recommendation number 1 is considered the optimal next step due to its direct link and informative snippet, offering a timely solution for reporting a missed bin collection.",
