As a council tenant or leaseholder, you can make improvements in and outside your home, but remember, you must get our written permission before you start. \u00a0\n  It is a condition of your tenancy or lease that you must tell us before you change the structure of the property or alter any of the fixtures and fittings. Here are some examples of common improvements which need our permission:</p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Adding, moving or rewiring electrics</li>\n    <li>Adding to or changing your heating or hot water system</li>\n    <li>Refitting a kitchen, bathroom or shower</li>\n    <li>Fitting a laminate or wood flooring</li>\n    <li>Putting in a driveway, hard-standing or paved parking area</li>\n    <li>Installing outside CCTV cameras/equipment</li>\n    <li>Installing a smart meter</li>\n    <li>Erecting a fence or decking</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>For a full list of what you\u2019ll need our permission for check online or talk to your Local Housing Office. And if you\u2019re planning something major like adding a conservatory or porch you must also obtain planning permission or building regulations.<br>\n  If you don\u2019t get the go-ahead from us first, we may have to remove whatever you have done and you could even be charged for the work to restore your home.<br>\n  Any alterations that you make are your responsibility to maintain and when you move out you will have to restore your home to its original condition ready for the next tenant. Remember to read the moving out standards for more details of what you must do before you move house.</p>\n\n  <h3>I just want to redecorate</h3>\n  <p>If you\u2019re only planning on minor DIY such as repainting or putting up wallpaper, you don\u2019t need to check with us first. You only need to tell us if you are making changes like those listed above (but if you\u2019re in any doubt please check with us!) For more information and advice on decorating visit our decorating webpage where you can also find out how you can claim a painting pack if you have moved in to a property that needs decorating.</p>\n\n  <h3>I\u2019ve already made alterations!</h3>\n  <p>If you have already made alterations to your home please let us know so we can check the work is in line with your tenancy agreement and that it has been carried properly and ensure your home is safe.</p>\n\n  <button type=\"button\">Back</button>\n</main>\n"

      "letter": "To: CEO  \nFrom: Web Manager (Usability Expert)  \nSubject: Recommendations for Enhancing the Online Tenant Self-Service Experience to Improve Efficiency and Reduce Costs  \n\nDear [CEO Name],  \n\nBased on a recent review of customer feedback, page content, and identified issues surrounding our tenant online application process, I am pleased to report some positive insights and also recommend specific improvements that could significantly enhance user experience, streamline service delivery, and generate cost savings for the council.  \n\n**Positive Feedback Highlights:**  \nThe tenant, David, expressed that the current information explains the process adequately. This indicates that the existing content is clear and helpful\u2014a commendable foundation that demonstrates effective communication. Kudos to the web team for creating accessible and comprehensive guidance that tenants can rely on.  \n\n**Areas for Improvement & Recommendations:**  \n\n1. **Simplify and Clarify Key Instructions:**  \n   - **Current Issue:** The language used in instructions such as \"It is a condition of your tenancy or lease that you must tell us before...,\" may be perceived as somewhat formal and complex.  \n   - **Suggested Improvement:** Implement straightforward, concise language like \"You need to inform us before making changes to your home.\"  \n   - **Impact:** Clear, simple wording reduces the cognitive load on tenants, decreases misunderstandings, and improves compliance with procedures\u2014all contributing to fewer administrative follow-ups and potential rework.  \n\n2. **Introduce an Online, Step-by-Step Application Form:**  \n   - **Current Issue:** The feedback indicates tenants want a direct, easy-to-access form or contact details for requests. Currently, there is an absence of a straightforward digital application link.  \n   - **Suggested Improvement:** Develop a dedicated online form tailored for flat improvement requests, incorporating a guided, step-by-step process that includes uploading photos or plans, and providing estimated response times. Additionally, prominently display contact details for further assistance.  \n   - **Impact:** A streamlined digital process can expedite applications, reduce phone and email inquiries, and lower administrative costs. It ensures transparency and provides tenants with real-time updates, addressing concerns about delays and missed communications.  \n\n3. **Show Clear Key Timelines and Updates:**  \n   - **Current Issue:** Concern about delays and lack of updates remains unaddressed on the webpage.  \n   - **Suggested Improvement:** Incorporate a standard timeline for decision-making within the application process and enable automated updates or notifications for tenants at each stage.  \n   - **Impact:** Better communication enhances tenant trust, reduces manual follow-ups, and prevents unnecessary administrative effort.  \n\n4. **Create a Visual Step-by-Step Guide for Tenants:**  \n   - **Current Issue:** There's an opportunity to reduce confusion by providing visual aids.  \n   - **Suggested Improvement:** Add visual flowcharts or infographics illustrating the application process, required documentation, and approval timelines.  \n   - **Impact:** Visual guides improve understanding, increase application success rates, and reduce incoming queries, ultimately freeing up staff resources.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nBy adopting these targeted improvements\u2014such as clear, simplified language, a dedicated online application workflow, real-time updates, and visual support\u2014we can significantly enhance the tenant experience. These changes will foster higher engagement, decrease administrative burdens, and contribute to cost savings through operational efficiencies.  \n\nI recommend prioritizing the development of a user-friendly online application form and communicative enhancements, as these measures will directly address tenant concerns, streamline approvals, and promote a more efficient, cost-effective service model.  \n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed implementation plan or further insights.  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Web Manager\u2019s Name]  \nUsability & Digital Service Lead"
