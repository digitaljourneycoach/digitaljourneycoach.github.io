      "letter": "Recommendation to the CEO from the Web Manager\n\nSubject: Enhancing Online Service Delivery for Council Tenants \u2013 Focused Improvements for Flat Modification Requests\n\nOverview:\nBased on recent user feedback and analysis of customer personas, it is evident that our current webpage designed for tenants requesting permission for flat improvements is lacking clarity and functionality. Particularly, the case of 'David', a council tenant who is comfortable with online processes but finds the current information insufficient, highlights critical areas for improvement.\n\nPositive Feedback:\nWhile the feedback points to significant gaps, the tenant\u2019s expressed desire for a simple online form, clear guidelines, and timely updates indicates a strong interest and potential for improved digital engagement. This is a promising foundation to build upon.\n\nSuggested Improvements:\n1. Develop a Structured Digital Process:\n   - Introduce a dedicated online form that allows tenants like David to submit requests for flat alterations, upload necessary documents (photos, plans), and receive instant confirmation of receipt.\n   - Integrate progress tracking so tenants can monitor the status in real time.\n\n2. Provide Clear, Step-by-Step Guidelines:\n   - Include a detailed guide on the webpage outlining each step of the approval process, documents needed, and allowable modifications.\n   - Clarify expected response times to set accurate expectations and reduce anxiety about delays.\n\n3. Enable Automated Updates and Notifications:\n   - Implement email or SMS notifications that inform tenants about receipt, progress, and final decisions.\n   - This proactive communication reduces the likelihood of tenants missing important updates and improves trust in our service.\n\nImpact on Customer Experience and Efficiency:\n- These enhancements will significantly improve user satisfaction by providing clarity and reducing frustration. For tenants like David, navigating the process will become more straightforward, likely increasing the number of successful, timely submissions.\n- From an operational perspective, automating updates and standardizing the process reduces the workload on staff by minimizing follow-up inquiries and manual status checks.\n- Enhanced digital self-service capabilities are expected to increase efficiency, leading to cost savings and freeing up resources for other priorities.\n\nConclusion:\nBy prioritizing the development of a comprehensive online application system coupled with clear guidance and transparent communication, we can transform a currently ambiguous process into an efficient, user-friendly service. This approach aligns with our commitment to digital excellence, enhances tenant satisfaction, and delivers measurable service cost savings.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Your Name]\nWeb Manager & Usability Specialist"
