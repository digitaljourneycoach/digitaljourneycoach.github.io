      "letter": "Based on the customer persona, feedback, and identified issues, I recommend the following actions to improve the online service experience and enhance operational efficiency for the council:\n\n1. Add Clear Response Timeframes and Notification Details:\n- Progress: Incorporate estimated response times for application processing and specify how updates will be communicated (e.g., email, SMS, or app notifications).\n- Impact: This will reduce uncertainty and anxiety for customers like David, increasing trust in the online service and decreasing the volume of follow-up inquiries. Clear expectations will improve user satisfaction and streamline case management.\n\n2. Implement a Step-by-Step Guided Process:\n- Progress: Develop a user-friendly, step-by-step guide within the form and process pages that clearly indicates each stage\u2014from application submission to final decision. Use visual cues, progress bars, and concise instructions.\n- Impact: Simplifying the process will boost customer confidence, minimize errors, and decrease the need for staff to clarify or manually rectify incomplete submissions\u2014saving time and reducing administrative costs.\n\n3. Specify Timelines for Approval and Feedback:\n- Progress: Clearly state expected decision times on the page (e.g., \"Decisions are typically made within 2 weeks\") and update customers proactively if delays occur.\n- Impact: Managing expectations reduces customer frustration and the risk of missed communications. It also helps the council manage workload expectations and plan resource allocation more effectively.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**\nBy enhancing the online form and information pages with clear timeframes, step-by-step guidance, and reliable notification methods, we can significantly improve the customer experience for tenants like David. These improvements will foster greater trust, reduce administrative overhead from avoidable follow-ups, and demonstrate our commitment to accessible, user-centered digital services\u2014ultimately saving the council money and improving service efficiency.\n\nI suggest prioritizing these updates in our ongoing digital improvement project to achieve measurable benefits both for customers and operational costs.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Web Manager Name]\nUsability & Digital Service Improvement Lead"
