The following information provides guidance for obtaining the correct consents, types of work that can and cannot be carried out, plus related fees for obtaining consent for alterations.</p>\n\n<h2>Requesting permission</h2>\n<p>Obtaining approval is a condition of your lease agreement with the council.</p>\n<p>To understand more about your lease and how this affects the work you wish to undertake, visit\u00a0<a href=\"#\">New Tenancies and Leases</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What if I do not obtain permission?</h2>\n<p>If you undertake works without seeking the council\u2019s permission, otherwise known as an unauthorised alteration, this is considered a breach of the terms of your lease. Unauthorised alterations are a serious matter and could have future implications for you as the leaseholder including:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>reinstating the property to its original condition if the alterations do not meet council standards. You will be required to meet any costs of reinstating the property to its original condition or making any further modifications to ensure compliance with building regulations.\u00a0</li>\n  <li>you are likely to encounter difficulties if you wish to sell your property. If you do not have landlord\u2019s consent for alterations, this can delay the sale of the property as potential buyers will want to ensure that you received the consent for the works.</li>\n  <li>if you undertake works that could be considered as dangerous or do not meet standards for the granting of landlord\u2019s consent, the council may also take further legal proceedings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Obtaining retrospective consent</h2>\n<p>You can make an application for retrospective consent if you have already started or have completed works without obtaining permission. If you have partially completed work, you are advised to stop immediately as an application for retrospective consent does not guarantee your alteration will be accepted. There will be a non-refundable fee for retrospective applications and are issued at a higher cost than standard applications.</p>\n\n<h2>What type of work / what permission is required</h2>\n<h3>Minor works</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Works such as painting and decoration, replacing fixtures and fittings, works of a \u201clike for like\u201d nature.\u00a0</li>\n  <li>Works based on a \u201clike for like\u201d basis, for example Kitchen and Bathroom refurbishments \u2013 application where formal Landlords Consent is required.\u00a0</li>\n  <li>Small scale works for example changes in the layout, moving/removing walls, creating a bathroom/shower room - a Licence to Alteration is required.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Major Works</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Larger schemes for example, basement development, loft conversion, roof terrace, extensions, conservatories \u2013 where a Licence to Alteration is required. In addition, a Deed of Variation may apply.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Next stage</h2>\n<p>Your enquiry will be referred to the Housing Management Leaseholder Alterations Team, who will liaise directly with you to progress your application.\u00a0A fee of \u00a3580 is payable before the team reviews your application.

      "letter": "To the CEO,\n\nSubject: Recommendations for Enhancing Online Application Process for Flat Improvements\n\nAs the web usability specialist tasked with optimizing our services, I have reviewed the customer persona, feedback, current web page content, identified issues, and potential improvements related to the online application process for council flat alterations. The following insights and recommendations aim to improve user experience, streamline the process, and enhance overall service efficiency, which can also contribute to cost savings for the council.\n\nPositive Feedback and Commendation:\nThe current online information effectively explains the overall process of requesting permission for flat improvements. The clarity around fees, necessary documentation, and legal considerations is appreciated. Great work to the web team for providing comprehensive guidance that helps tenants understand their obligations and the importance of proper authorization.\n\nAreas for Specific Improvements:\n1. Clarify the Application Steps and Timeline:\n   - Issue Identified: The process of how applications are reviewed and how long each step takes is vague, leading to uncertainty.\n   - Proposed Enhancement: Implement a clear, step-by-step online checklist that guides users through the application process. Include estimated timelines (e.g., \u201cWe will review your application within 10 working days and contact you to discuss next steps.\u201d).\n   - Impact: This reduces user anxiety, decreases repetitive support inquiries, and speeds up the overall process as tenants know what to expect.\n\n2. Make Payment Instructions Explicit:\n   - Issue Identified: The current description of the fee payment is generic, lacking specific instructions.\n   - Proposed Enhancement: Incorporate direct links to a secure online payment portal with step-by-step instructions. Clarify that payment must be made before the application review begins.\n   - Impact: Simplifies the payment process, minimizes user confusion, reduces administrative follow-up, and accelerates application processing, saving staff hours and resources.\n\n3. Communicate Clear Timeframes for Follow-up:\n   - Issue Identified: No firm timeframe for receiving further guidance after approval.\n   - Proposed Enhancement: Set and communicate a standard follow-up timeline (e.g., \u201cExpect to receive additional guidance within 15 working days of approval\u201d).\n   - Impact: Better manage customer expectations, reduce inbound queries, and encourage tenants to proceed confidently with their projects, thus improving satisfaction and reducing administrative workload.\n\nOverall, these targeted improvements will create a more transparent, predictable, and user-friendly online process. Enhanced clarity reduces errors, avoids delays caused by misunderstandings, and encourages tenants to comply correctly with policy, ultimately saving the council time and costs associated with rectifying non-compliant or incomplete applications.\n\nI recommend prioritizing the development of an interactive, step-by-step online application guide with integrated payment instructions and timeline estimates. These enhancements will significantly improve our service experience, foster greater tenant compliance, and deliver operational efficiencies.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Web Manager's Name]\nUsability and Service Optimization Lead"
